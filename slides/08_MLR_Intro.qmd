# Learning Objectives

1.  Understand equations and visualizations that helps us build multiple linear regression model.
2.  Fit MLR model (in `R`) and understand the difference between fitted regression plane and regression lines.
3.  Identify the population multiple linear regression model and define statistics language for key notation.
4.  Based off of previous SLR work, understand how the population MLR is estimated.
5.  Interpret MLR (population) coefficient estimates with additional variable in model

## Reminder of what we learned in the context of SLR

-   SLR helped us establish the foundation for a lot of regression

    -   But we do not usually use SLR in analysis
    
**What did we learn in SLR??**

:::

 

-   Has $k+1$ total coefficients (including intercept) for $k$ predictors/covariates
-   Sometimes referred to as ***multivariable*** linear regression, but *never multivariate*
:::
:::

 

-   The models have similar "LINE" assumptions and follow the same general diagnostic procedure

## Going back to our life expectancy example

-   Let's say many other variables were measured for each country, including food supply

    -   [**Food Supply**](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home) (kilocalories per person per day, kc PPD): the average kilocalories consumed by a person each day.

-   In SLR, we only had one predictor and one outcome in the model:

    -   [**Life expectancy**](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd004/) = the average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.

    -   [**Adult literacy rate**](http://data.uis.unesco.org/) is the percentage of people ages 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life.

 

-   Do we think adult female literacy rate is going to explain a lot of the variance of life expectancy between countries?

## Loading the (new-*ish*) data

```{r}
# Load the data - update code if the csv file is not in the same location on your computer
# If you need to download the file, please go to ur shared folder under Data > Slides
gapm <- read_excel("data/Gapminder_vars_2011.xlsx", 
                   na = "NA")  # important!!!! 

gapm_sub <- gapm %>% 
  drop_na(LifeExpectancyYrs, FemaleLiteracyRate, FoodSupplykcPPD)

glimpse(gapm_sub)
```

## Can we improve our model by adding food supply as a covariate?

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

# Learning Objectives

1.  Understand equations and visualizations that helps us build multiple linear regression model.

::: lob
2.  Fit MLR model (in `R`) and understand the difference between fitted regression plane and regression lines.
:::

3.  Identify the population multiple linear regression model and define statistics language for key notation.
4.  Based off of previous SLR work, understand how the population MLR is estimated.
5.  Interpret MLR (population) coefficient estimates with additional variable in model

## How do we fit a multiple linear regression model in R?

New population model for example:

$$\text{Life expectancy} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Female literacy rate} + \beta_2 \text{Food supply} + \epsilon$$

```{r}
# Fit regression model:
mr1 <- lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate + FoodSupplykcPPD, 
          data = gapm_sub)
tidy(mr1, conf.int=T) %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

Fitted multiple regression model:

$$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\text{Life expectancy}} &= \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \text{Female literacy rate} + \widehat{\beta}_2 \text{Food supply} \\
\widehat{\text{Life expectancy}} &= 33.595 + 0.157\ \text{Female literacy rate} 
+ 0.008\ \text{Food supply}
\end{aligned}$$

## Don't forget `summary()` to extract information!

```{r}
summary(mr1)
```

## Visualize the fitted multiple regression model

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   The fitted model equation $$\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot X_1 + \widehat{\beta}_2 \cdot X_2$$ has three variables ($Y, X_1,$ and $X_2$) and thus we need 3 dimensions to plot it

 

-   Instead of a regression line, we get a **regression plane**
    -   *See code in `.qmd`- file. I hid it from view in the html file.*

:::

5.  Interpret MLR (population) coefficient estimates with additional variable in model

## How do we estimate the model parameters?

-   We need to estimate the population model coefficients $\widehat{\beta}_0, \widehat{\beta}_1, \widehat{\beta}_2, \ldots, \widehat{\beta}_k$
-   This can be done using the **ordinary least-squares method**
    -   Find the $\widehat{\beta}$ values that **minimize** the sum of squares due to error ($SSE$)

$$ \begin{aligned}
SSE & = \displaystyle\sum^n_{i=1} \widehat\epsilon_i^2 \\
SSE & = \displaystyle\sum^n_{i=1} (Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i)^2 \\
SSE & = \displaystyle\sum^n_{i=1} (Y_i - (\widehat{\beta}_0 +\widehat{\beta}_1 X_{i1}+ \ldots+\widehat{\beta}_1 X_{ik}))^2 \\
SSE & = \displaystyle\sum^n_{i=1} (Y_i - \widehat{\beta}_0 -\widehat{\beta}_1 X_{i1}- \ldots-\widehat{\beta}_1 X_{ik})^2
\end{aligned}$$

## Technical side note (not needed in our class)

-   The equations for calculating the $\boldsymbol{\widehat{\beta}}$ values is best done using matrix notation (not required for our class)

-   We will be using R to get the coefficients instead of the equation (already did this a few slides back!)

## Summary of the LINE assumptions

-   Equivalently, the residuals are independently and identically distributed (iid):
    -   normal
    -   with mean 0 and
    -   constant variance $\sigma^2$

## Variation: Explained vs. Unexplained

$$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 &= \sum_{i=1}^n (\widehat{Y}_i- \bar{Y})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i)^2 \\
SSY &= SSR + SSE
\end{aligned}$$

-   $Y_i - \bar{Y}$ = the deviation of $Y_i$ around the mean $\bar{Y}$
    -   (the **total** amount deviation unexplained at $X_{i1},\ldots,X_{ik}$ ).
-   $Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i$ = the deviation of the observation $Y$ around the fitted regression line
    -   (the amount deviation **unexplained** by the regression at $X_{i1},\ldots,X_{ik}$ ).
-   $\widehat{Y}_i- \bar{Y}$ = the deviation of the fitted value $\widehat{Y}_i$ around the mean $\bar{Y}$
    -   (the amount deviation **explained** by the regression at $X_{i1},\ldots,X_{ik}$ ).

# Learning Objectives

1.  Understand equations and visualizations that helps us build multiple linear regression model.
2.  Fit MLR model (in `R`) and understand the difference between fitted regression plane and regression lines.
3.  Identify the population multiple linear regression model and define statistics language for key notation.
4.  Based off of previous SLR work, understand how the population MLR is estimated.

5.  Interpret MLR (population) coefficient estimates with additional variable in model

## Interpreting the estimated population coefficients

-   For a population model: $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2+ \epsilon$$
    -   Where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are continuous variables
    -   No need to specify $Y$ because it required to be continuous in linear regression

## Poll Everywhere Question 4


## Getting these interpretations from our regression table

We fit the regression model in R and printed the regression table:

```{r}
mr1 <- lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate + FoodSupplykcPPD, 
          data = gapm_sub)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
tidy(mr1, conf.int=T) %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 30) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

Fitted multiple regression model: $\widehat{\text{LE}} = 33.595 + 0.157 \text{ FLR} + 0.008 \text{ FS}$
