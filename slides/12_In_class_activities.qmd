## Example

-   The following example comes from **this textbook**

> Suppose that we are conducting an observational study of adults to assess whether physical activity level (PAL) is associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), accounting (i.e., controlling) for AGE and SAB (sex assigned at birth). The extraneous variable here is AGE and SAB, while the explanatory variable (variable of interest) is PAL. We need to determine whether we can ignore AGE and/or SAB in our analysis and still correctly assess the PALâ€“SBP association.

## Explore the data: First thing to do

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

ggplot(SBP) + geom_histogram(aes(x = SBP))
ggplot(SBP) + geom_histogram(aes(x = PAL))
ggplot(SBP) + geom_histogram(aes(x = AGE))
```
