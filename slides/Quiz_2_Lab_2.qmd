# Quiz 2

## Overall

-   Great job!
-   Just a few things to review

## Question 2

$$
SSY = SST = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2

# Lab 2

## Overall

-   Overall, good job! I feel like we're making progress towards our analysis with thoughtful considerations for the data

-   I definitely steered us towards thinking about the defined population

    -   Make sure you also think about over-representation

    -   Over-representation does NOT mean we cannot make claims about the under-represented, but present, groups

-   When visualizing, making tables, displaying information from the data: always keep in the back of your mind:

    -   What can a reader get from this if they have never seen the data?

    -   Is it easy for the reader to understand the plot?

    -   Does everything in the plot have a purpose?

    -   Is the main thing I'm trying to communicate also the thing that stands out?

-   Bivariate visualization was supposed to visualize our research question

## Notes on coding

-   `#| message: false` Please use after troubleshooting your code

    -   Especially when loading libraries! Makes everything neater

-   When assigning category names, capitalization of the first word in each category is customary

## Notes on coding/visualization

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Did not take off, but ordering any categorical variables with inherent order is really helpful in our visualizations

    -   Also, tilting category names is helpful!

## Notes on interpretations/considerations

-   Remember that multiple linear regression will adjust for variables outside of our research question!

    -   So we either adjust with a main effect or an interaction!

## How should a plot look?

## How should a table look?

# Mid-term feedback

## Overall

-   Only 29 names recorded: should be in gradebook now

-   Appreciate your feedback

-   I will try to address some of these

    -   Balancing bandwidth, equity, different opinions, and things that are just a consequence of me teaching the course for the first time

-   Still seeing what I can change ASAP

## In-class (1/2)

-   Sometimes my own explanations get confusing - would prefer if I revisited topics later rather than going through bad explanation

    -   Fair enough: a few things over the quarter that I have taken for granted that I can riff a solid explanation, but I cannot

-   Lecture notes in PDF: go to [github](https://github.com/nwakim/W2024_BSTA_512), and I will have a PDF version there by the start of class

-   Pace of class: **mixture of opinions**

-   Exit tickets: **some people don't like them, some do, repetitive**

    -   I made all the questions optional now - so fill it out or not, but this is my way of keeping a pulse on how effective lecture was

        -   And this will still be my way of making sure we are staying with the course materials

        -   I view this as an easy way to earn points that take weight away from higher stakes assignments

-   Datasets: **some like that we have one dataset, and some want more**

    -   Next quarter: have \~2 quarter long datasets (highly dependent on my course load next quarter)

-   R code: **mixture of opinions**

    -   Less/more, too much time explaining/too little time explaining

## In-class (2/2)

-   Poll everywheres: **mixture of opinions**

    -   My main goal: give you all a "productive" break from me lecturing you

-   More real world examples to demonstrate concepts

-   More structure to lectures - wrapping up concepts, learning objectives

-   Lectures: scrollable html option?

-   Towards beginning of course: mistakes in slides and due dates

## Homework

-   Feedback on HW would be great

-   Posting earlier: for this quarter - I just don't have time :(

-   **Referencing a TB in homework and in class: some confusion if you need to read it on your own**

    -   You don't!

    -   I am mostly referencing these things for copyright issues because I am publicly publishing our slides, homeworks, labs, etc.

## Quizzes

-   **Some like the format, some don't**

-   We like the open note

-   Some: more of a test if you can search through the slides

-   **Options for quizzes: we can brainstorm for next quarter**

    -   Ultimately, I have to balance time, cheating, equity of take-home

## Labs / Project

-   Would be nice to have a lab section

-   Labs divided into smaller chunks

    -   Balancing with homework assignments

## Things we like

-   Notes with annotations and recording

    -   Option for asynchronous viewing, in-person attendance not required

-   Engaging lectures (for some)

    -   "...slides are my best friend."

-   Descriptions in multiple ways, learning types

-   Concepts then code

-   Flexibility

-   Easy to understand terms when explaining

-   Judgement free zone

## Final words

-   Saw a few students discuss how the volume of work this quarter is giving them anxiety, making them feel inadequate, etc.

    -   I understand and have experienced the same feeling - not saying any of us should experience it

    -   Keep going! Your grades are not your worth! You belong here! I want you to succeed!

    -   Finally, you are LEARNING!

        -   You will get things wrong. Hopefully you and your professors are giving you some grace.

        -   I am still learning! I still reference things from my old classes

            -   It's all about setting a foundation so that you know some things and know how to reference materials/internet/books to fill in gaps

-   If I missed anything important to you in your feedback, please share in the [anonymous on-going feedback](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=V3lz4rj6fk2U9pvWr59xWFMopmPUjRtDiHLswhgacNhURDc2S1dGNTlTRVJVUFoyQUUzNFJMS0JXUi4u)
