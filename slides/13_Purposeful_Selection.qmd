## Overall Process

0.  Exploratory data analysis

1.  Check unadjusted associations in simple linear regression

2.  Enter all covariates in model that meet some threshold

    -   [One textbook](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118548387) suggest $p<0.2$ or $p<0.25$: great for modest sized datasets
    -   PLEASE keep in mind sample size in your study
    -   Can also use magnitude of association rather than, or along with, p-value

3.  Remove those that no longer reach some threshold

    -   Compare magnitude of associations to unadjusted version (univariable)

4.  Check scaling of continuous and coding of categorical covariates

5.  Check for interactions

6.  Assess model fit

    -   Model assumptions, diagnostics, overall fit

## Pre-step: Exploratory data analysis

-   Things we have been doing over the quarter in class and in our project 
-   I will not discuss some of the methods mentioned in our lab and data management class

    -   I am only going to introduce additional exploratory functions

 

A few things we can do: 

-   Check the data
-   Study your variables
-   Missing data?
-   Explore simple relationships and assumptions

## Pre-step: Exploratory data analysis: Check the data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Get to know the potential values for the data

    -   Categories

    -   Units

-   Then make sure the summary of values makes sense

    -   If minimum or maximum look outside appropriate range
    -   For example: a negative value for a measurement that is inherently positive (like population or income)

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

## Pre-step: Exploratory data analysis: Study your variables

-   Started this a little bit in previous slide (`skim()`), but you may want to look at things like:

    -   Sample size
    -   Counts of missing data
    -   Means and standard deviations
    -   IQRs
    -   Medians
    -   Minimums and maximums

-   Can also look at visuals
    -   Continuous variables: histograms (in `skimr() a little)
    -   Categorical variables: frequency plots

## Pre-step: Exploratory data analysis: Study your variables {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(Hmisc)
hist.data.frame(gapm %>% select(-Longitude, -Latitude, -eight_regions, -six_regions, -geo, -`World bank, 4 income groups 2017`, -country, -population, -`World bank region`, -ElectricityUsePP))
```

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

## Pre-step: Exploratory data analysis: Missing data

-   Why are there missing data?
-   Which variables and observations should be excluded because of missing data?
-   Will I impute missing data?

 

-   Unfortunately, we don’t have time to discuss missing data more thoroughly  
-   I will try to cover this topic more thoroughly in BSTA 513

 

-   For the Gapminder dataset, we chose to use complete cases

## Pre-step / Step 1 : Explore simple relationships and assumptions {.smaller}

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| echo: true

gapm2 %>% ggpairs() # gapm2 is a new dataset with some variables selected
```

## Poll Everywhere Question 3

## Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis

-   For each covariate, we want to see how it relates to the outcome (without adjusting for other covariates)

-   We can partially do this with **visualizations**

    -   Helps us see the data we throw it into regression that makes assumptions (like our LINE assumptions)

    -   `ggpairs()` can be a quick way to do it
    -   `ggplot()` can make each plot
    
          -   `+ geom_boxplot()` to make boxplots by groups for categorical covariates
          -   `+ geom_jitter() + stat_summary()` to make non-overlaping points with group means for categorical covariates
          -   `+ geom_point()` to make scatterplots for continuous covariates
      
-   We need to run **simple linear regression** 

    -   We're calling regression with multi-level categories "simple" even though there are multiple coefficients
    
## Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis

-   Let's think back to our Gapminder dataset

-   Always good to start with our main relationship: life expectancy vs. female literacy rate 

    -   *Throwback to Lesson 3 SLR when we first visualized and ran `lm()` for this relationship*

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

model_FLR = lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate, data = gapm_sub)
```

 

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r}
#| fig-height: 8
#| fig-width: 11
#| echo: false

ggplot(gapm_sub, aes(x = FemaleLiteracyRate,
                 y = LifeExpectancyYrs)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 3, colour="#F14124") +
  labs(x = "Female literacy rate (%)", 
       y = "Life expectancy (years)",
       title = "Relationship between life expectancy and \n the female literacy rate in 2011") +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 30), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 25), 
        title = element_text(size = 30))

```
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
```{r}
model_FLR = lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate, data = gapm_sub)
tidy(model_FLR) %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 40) %>% 
  fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```
:::
:::

## Poll Everywhere Question 4

## Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis

-   Let's do this with one other variable before I show you a streamlined version of SLR

```{r}
#| echo: true

model_WR = lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ four_regions, data = gapm_sub)
```

 

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=7, warning=F, fig.align='center'}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(gapm_sub, aes(x = four_regions, y = LifeExpectancyYrs)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 1, alpha = .6, width = 0.2) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 8, shape = 18) +
  labs(x = "World region", 
       y = "Country life expectancy (years)",
       title = "Life expectancy vs. world region",
       caption = "Diamonds = region averages") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 20), 
        title = element_text(size = 20))
```
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true

anova(model_WR) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%
   tab_options(table.font.size = 40) %>%
   fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

 

-   Recall from Lesson 5 (SLR: More inference + Evaluation):

    -   `anova()` with one model name will compare the model (`model_WR`) to the intercept model
:::
:::

## Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis

-   If we do a good job visualizing the relationship between our outcome and each covariate, then we can proceed to a streamlined version of the F-test for each relationship

-   First, I will select the variables that we are considering for model selection:
```{r}
#| echo: true

gapm2 = gapm_sub %>% select(LifeExpectancyYrs, CO2emissions, FoodSupplykcPPD, 
                            IncomePP, FemaleLiteracyRate, WaterSourcePrct, 
                            four_regions, members_oecd_g77)
```

-   We need to make sure our dataset only contains the variables we are considering for the model:

```{r}
#| echo: true
gapm3 = gapm2 %>% select(-LifeExpectancyYrs)
```

## Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis {.smaller}

-   Now I can run the `lapply()` function, which allows me to run the same function multiple times over all the columns in `gapm3`

-   For each covariate I am running: `lm(gapm2$LifeExpectancyYrs ~ x) %>% anova()`

    -   So I am fitting the simple linear regression and printing the ANOVA table with F-test (comparing model with a without the covariate)
    
```{r}
#| echo: true
lapply( gapm3, function(x) lm(gapm2$LifeExpectancyYrs ~ x) %>% anova() )
```

-   We can scroll through the output to see the ANOVA table for each covariate

## Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis

-   We can also filter the ANOVA table to just show the p-value for each F-test

```{r}
#| echo: true
sapply( gapm3, function(x) anova( lm(gapm2$LifeExpectancyYrs ~ x) )$`Pr(>F)` )
```

-   Row 1 is the p-value for the F-test

    -   This will help us in Step 2

## Step 2: Preliminary variable selection

-   Identify candidates for your first multivariable model by performing an F-test on each covariate's SLR 

    -   Using p-values from previous slide
    -   If the p-value of the test is less than 0.25, then consider the variable a candidate

 

-   Candidates for first multivariable model

    -   All clinically important variables (regardless of p-value)
    -   Variables with univariate test with p-value < 0.25

 

-   With more experience, you won’t need to rely on these strict rules as much

## Step 2: Preliminary variable selection

-   From the previous p-values from the F-test on each covariate's SLR

    -   Decision: we keep all the covariates since they all have a p-value < 0.25
    
```{r}
#| echo: true
sapply( gapm3, function(x) anova( lm(gapm2$LifeExpectancyYrs ~ x) )$`Pr(>F)` )
```

## Step 2: Preliminary variable selection

-   Fit an **initial model** including any independent variable with p-value < 0.25 and clinically important variables

```{r}
#| echo: true

init_model = lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate + CO2emissions + IncomePP +
               four_regions + WaterSourcePrct + FoodSupplykcPPD + members_oecd_g77, 
                 data = gapm2)
tidy(init_model, conf.int = T) %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 30) %>% 
  fmt_number(decimals = 4)
```

## Step 3: Assess change in coefficient

::: columns

::: {.column width="48%"}
-   This is where we start identifying covariates that we might remove

 

-   I would start by using the p-value to guide me towards specific variables

    -   Female literacy rate, but that's our main covariate
    -   `members_oecd_g77`
    -   Maybe water source percent?
    
 

-   Some people will say you can use the p-value alone

    -   I like to double check that those variables do not have a large effect on the other coefficients
:::

::: {.column width="52%"}
```{r}
tidy(init_model) %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 33) %>%  
  fmt_number(decimals = 4)
```
:::

:::

## Step 3: Assess change in coefficient

-   Very similar to the process we used when looking at confounders

 

-   One variable at a time, we run the multivariable model with and without the variable

    -   We look at the p-value of the F-test for the coefficients of said variable
    -   We look at the percent change for the coefficient ($\Delta\%$) of our explanatory variable
    
 

-   General rule: We can remove a variable if...

    -   p-value > 0.05 for the F-test of its own coefficients
    -   AND change in coefficient ($\Delta\%$) of our explanatory variable is < 10%
    
## Step 3: Assess change in coefficient

-   Let's try this out on `members_oecd_g77`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Display the ANOVA table with F-statistic and p-value"

model_full = init_model
model_red = lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate + CO2emissions + IncomePP +
               four_regions + WaterSourcePrct + FoodSupplykcPPD, 
                 data = gapm2)
anova(model_full, model_red) %>% tidy() %>% 
  gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Display the FLR coefficient for both models"
#| include: false

tidy(model_full) %>% 
  gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
tidy(model_red) %>% 
  gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

-   $\widehat\beta_{FLR, full} = `r round(tidy(model_full)[2,2], 4)`$, $\widehat\beta_{FLR, red} = `r round(tidy(model_red)[2,2], 4)`$

\Delta\% = 100\% \cdot \frac{\widehat\beta_{FLR, full} - \widehat\beta_{FLR, red}}{\widehat\beta_{FLR, full}} = 100\% \cdot \frac{`r round(tidy(model_full)[2,2], 4)` - `r round(tidy(model_red)[2,2], 4)`}{`r round(tidy(model_full)[2,2], 4)`} = `r round(100*(tidy(model_full)[2,2] - tidy(model_red)[2,2])/tidy(model_full)[2,2], 2)`\%
$$

-   Based off the percent change, I would keep this in the model

## Step 3: Assess change in coefficient

-   Let's try this out on water source percent (even though the p-value was < 0.05)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Display the ANOVA table with F-statistic and p-value"

model_full = init_model
model_red = lm(LifeExpectancyYrs ~ FemaleLiteracyRate + CO2emissions + IncomePP +
               four_regions + members_oecd_g77 + FoodSupplykcPPD, 
                 data = gapm2)
anova(model_full, model_red) %>% tidy() %>% 
  gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Display the FLR coefficient for both models"
#| include: false

tidy(model_full) %>% 
  gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
tidy(model_red) %>% 
  gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>% fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

-   $\widehat\beta_{FLR, full} = `r round(tidy(model_full)[2,2], 4)`$, $\widehat\beta_{FLR, red} = `r round(tidy(model_red)[2,2], 4)`$

$$
\Delta\% = 100\% \cdot \frac{\widehat\beta_{FLR, full} - \widehat\beta_{FLR, red}}{\widehat\beta_{FLR, full}} = 100\% \cdot \frac{`r round(tidy(model_full)[2,2], 4)` - `r round(tidy(model_red)[2,2], 4)`}{`r round(tidy(model_full)[2,2], 4)`} = `r round(100*(tidy(model_full)[2,2] - tidy(model_red)[2,2])/tidy(model_full)[2,2], 2)`\%
$$

-   Based off the percent change (and p-value), I would keep this in the model

## Step 3: Assess change in coefficient

-   At the end of this step, we have a **preliminary main effects model**

-   Where the variables are excluded that met the following criteria:

    -   P-value > 0.05 for the F-test of its own coefficients
    -   Change in coefficient ($\Delta\%$) of our explanatory variable is < 10%
    
-   In our example, the **preliminary main effects model** (end of Step 3) was the same as the **intiial model** (end of Step 2)

## Step 4: Assess scale for continuous variables

-   To assess the linearity for continuous variables in the model

-   We assume the linear regression model is linear in the logit scale for each continuous variable

-   Four methods/approaches to check or address the assumption of linearity: 

    -   Approach 1: Smoothed scatter plots (check only)
    -   Approach 2: Quartile method/Design variable
    -   Approach 3: Fractional Polynomials
    -   Approach 4: Spline functions

-   Model at the end of Step 4 is the main effects model

## Step 5: Check for interactions

-   Create a list of interaction terms from variables in the "main effects model" that has clinical plausibility

-   Add the interaction variables, one at a time, to the main effects model, and assess the significance using a likelihood ratio test or Wald test

    -   May keep interaction terms with p-value < 0.05 

-   Keep the main effects untouched, only simplify the interaction terms – locked!

-   Use methods from Step 2 (comparing model with all interactions to a smaller model with interactions) to determine which interactions to keep

-   The model by the end of Step 6 is called  the preliminary final model 


## Step 6: Assess model fit

-   Assess the adequacy of the model and check its fit

-   Methods will be discussed later class 

-   If the model is adequate and fits well, then it is the Final model
