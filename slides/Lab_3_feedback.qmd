## Overall

-   Great work! I know there was a lot of plotting, but you made some great plots!

-   I also appreciate your thoughtful approaches to the relationships between variables

-   Just a reminder: when visualizing, making tables, displaying information from the data: always keep in the back of your mind:

    -   What can a reader get from this if they have never seen the data?

    -   Is it easy for the reader to understand the plot?

    -   Does everything in the plot have a purpose?

    -   Is the main thing I'm trying to communicate also the thing that stands out?

## A few catches

-   I said glimpse, but that was a bad choice of words

    -   `head()` might be better to show each row with their observations and variables

-   When we were looking into observations that might be suspicious...

    -   We should look at the intersection of multiple suspicious observations

    -   A few combinations that people came up with that I thought were good ideas:

        -   Someone who chose that they felt extremely similar to fat and thin people

        -   Someone who reported they were 11-14 years old with education above high school (or other age/education combos)

-   If the variable is an explanatory variable and originally categorical, it's good to *keep it categorical*

    -   Lots of `lm()` functions with variable treated as continuous

## Multi-selection variables 1

-   Splitting gender identities is NOT mutually exclusive

    -   Can identify as all genders!

-   If you are trying pinpoint one group and make it mutually exclusive, we need to take extra steps

-   Someone wanted to identify three groups:

    -   Identifies as trans man, trans woman, genderqueer/non-conforming, and/or different identity
    -   Identifies as man only
    -   Identifies as woman only

-   Point on data equity:

    -   Always write out all identities within a grouped category

    -   I did not call the group something like non-normative genders, instead I said "Identifies as trans man, trans woman, genderqueer/non-conforming, and/or other"

    -   Your coding names in `R` can be different, but when you write it out, make sure you define the group

        -   I would maybe call the first group "Trans and non-binary genders" with an exact make up of the group.

## Multi-selection variables 2 {.smaller}

-   Create indicators for each identity: don't any lose information on the individual

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
iat_new = iat_old %>%
  mutate(ind_m = grepl(1, genderIdentity), 
         ind_f = grepl(2, genderIdentity),
         ind_tmm = grepl(3, genderIdentity),
         ind_twf = grepl(4, genderIdentity),
         ind_gqnc = grepl(5, genderIdentity),
         ind_diff = grepl(6, genderIdentity))
```

-   Create mutually exclusive groups: lose some information on the individual

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
iat_new = iat_old %>% # iat_old should not have any NA's in genderIdentity
  mutate(genderID = case_match(genderIdentity,
                               "[1]" ~ "Male/Man only",
                               "[2]" ~ "Female/Woman only",
                               .default = "Trans male/man, trans female/woman, 
                               genderqueer/non-conforming, or differnt identity"))
```

-   Example : if someone identifies as a man and a trans man, their data are like:

    -   $I(Gender = \text{Male/Man only}) = 0$
    -   $I(Gender = \text{Female/Woman only}) = 0$
    -   $I(Gender = \text{Trans male/man, trans female/woman, genderqueer/non-conforming, or different identity}) = 1$

## About confounders and effect modifiers

-   When hypothesizing whether a variable a confounder or effect modifier

    -   Make sure to back any claims in your final report with sources

    -   We can speculate what's at play, but we can't actually know

    -   Our own identity may bias how we perceive specific dynamics

-   Education: I saw many of us speculate that higher education may be associated with lower IAT (as a potential confounder)

    -   Data showed the opposite: higher education, higher mean IAT score

    -   We can think about people's perception of controllability of weight: do people assume certain behaviors about fat people?

        -   Does that align with or go against people's assumptions about behavior needed for higher education?

        -   We also need to think about how education might be linked to socio-economic status, and how that might change what food is affordable

    -   Heavily discussed in Maintenance Phase podcast, but I don't have direct sources

## Notes on plotting

-   `scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10))`: use this to wrap the text on x-axis

    -   Student used this and I loved it!

-   Keep your explanatory variable on the x-axis when you are plottinf three variables at once

-   `hjust` and `vjust` will move your text on the x axis so it does not cover your plot

-   Plotting age vs. IAT

    -   `geom_smooth()` to show moving mean value

    -   Boxplots and plotting each mean not exactly right for continuous variables

    -   See Lab 4 for how I plot this!

-   In `geom_smooth()`, when to use `method = lm`

    -   Do not use if trying to see how data look

## As we go into Lab 4 and Project Report

-   If IAT score ranges from -2 to 2, what changes in mean IAT is a lot?

    -   0.05: about 1.25% change
    -   0.5: about 12.5% change

-   A lot of the coefficients may be significant, but are they clinically meaningful?
