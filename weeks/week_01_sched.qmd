## Resources

Below is a table with links to resources. Icons in [orange]{style="color:#E89543;"} mean there is an available file link.

| Lesson | Topic           | Slides | Annotated Slides | Recording(s) |
|--------|-----------------|:------:|:----------------:|:------------:|
|        | Intro           |        |                  |              |
| 1      | Review          |        |                  |              |
| 2      | Data Management |        |                  |              |

For the slides, once they are opened, if you would like to print or save them as a PDF, the best way to do this is:

1.  Click on the icon with three horizontal bars on the bottom left of the browser.
2.  Click on "Tools" with the gear icon at the top of the sidebar.
3.  Click on "PDF Export Mode."
4.  From there, you can print or save the PDF as you would normally from your internet browser.
    1.  For example, in Chrome: I would click on the 3 vertical dots in the top right corner, then click Print, then change the Destination to "Save as PDF."
    2.  It doesn't seem to work well in Safari... Let me know if you're having trouble.
