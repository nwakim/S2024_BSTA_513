## Announcements

### Monday 1/8

-   We came from two different sections of the same course

    -   While I am confident we all learned a lot and mostly the same material

    -   We definitely learned it in different ways

    -   Three components of 511/512/513

        -   Theory

        -   Application

        -   Coding

-   There is a workshop on Friday, 1/12

    -   [Data Equity Primer](https://weallcount.com/the-data-equity-primer/) from We All Count

    -   ~~If you attend, I will give you an extra 3% on your project report.~~

    -   Unfortunately, I was in contact with the workshop, but they cannot offer free seats to the whole class.

    -   I am attending, and will try to see if I can share a recording afterwards!

-   Here are a few resources if youâ€™d like to practice R:

    -   [https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCq7ufpNjA$ "https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCq7ufpNjA$")

    -   [https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/r-bootcamp.netlify.app/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCqkZiESbE$ "https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/r-bootcamp.netlify.app/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCqkZiESbE$")

        -   This is step by step, and lets you practice your code in real time

        -   We will use `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr` extensively in this class!

        -   I am happy to help with coding, but during our class time our focus will by statistics topics

            -   Coding help will mostly be done outside of class time

-   We will also be using an attachment within Rstudio called Quarto

    -   Here is a great tutorial on Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html>

        -   Mine is the Quarto queen!

        -   There is some expectation of knowledge with the above packages (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`)
