For the slides, once they are opened, if you would like to print or save them as a PDF, the best way to do this is:

1.  Click on the icon with three horizontal bars on the bottom left of the browser.
2.  Click on "Tools" with the gear icon at the top of the sidebar.
3.  Click on "PDF Export Mode."
4.  From there, you can print or save the PDF as you would normally from your internet browser.
    1.  For example, in Chrome: I would click on the 3 vertical dots in the top right corner, then click Print, then change the Destination to "Save as PDF."
    2.  It doesn't seem to work well in Safari... Let me know if you're having trouble.

## Announcements

### Monday 1/8

-   We came from two different sections of the same course
    -   While I am confident we all learned a lot and mostly the same material
    -   We definitely learned it in different ways
    -   Three components of 511/512/513
        -   Theory
        -   Application
        -   Coding
-   There is a workshop on Friday, 1/12
    -   [Data Equity Primer](https://weallcount.com/the-data-equity-primer/) from We All Count
    -   ~~If you attend, I will give you an extra 3% on your project report.~~
    -   Unfortunately, I was in contact with the workshop, but they cannot offer free seats to the whole class.
    -   I am attending, and will try to see if I can share a recording afterwards!
-   Here are a few resources if youâ€™d like to practice R:
    -   [https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCq7ufpNjA$ "https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCq7ufpNjA$")
    -   [https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/r-bootcamp.netlify.app/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCqkZiESbE$ "https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/r-bootcamp.netlify.app/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCqkZiESbE$")
        -   This is step by step, and lets you practice your code in real time
        -   We will use `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr` extensively in this class!
        -   I am happy to help with coding, but during our class time our focus will by statistics topics
            -   Coding help will mostly be done outside of class time
-   We will also be using an attachment within Rstudio called Quarto
    -   Here is a great tutorial on Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html>
        -   Mine is the Quarto queen!
        -   There is some expectation of knowledge with the above packages (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`)

### Wednesday 1/10

-   Aha! I finally found the fun source on connecting tests from 511 to linear models!!
    -   [Here is the site](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)
    -   And here is the cheat sheet: ![](week_01/linear_tests_cheat_sheet.png)
-   Website updates
    -   Please see the muddiest points below
        -   I try to elaborate/answer questions from your exit tickets
    -   Schedule updated to include Holidays
    -   New resources tab that I will try to update after every class!
-   Asking about getting a different room - seems like we're cramped
-   Lab grading
    -   Each lab will be graded using a rubric (on each lab page)
    -   You will need to hit specific points to get full credit for the lab
    -   This is not a "turn in as is" assignment. You need to turn it in on time OR ask me for an extension.
        -   It is likely that I can give you a few more days to finish
    -   For labs, you will have ONE no-questions-asked, 3-day extension. Please use this wisely! You just need to send me a quick email saying "I am using my no-questions-asked extension for Lab \_\_."
        -   If you need another extension, then you need to email me to ask

## Additional Information

As we start the course, here are some administrative items that we need to do:

-   Please join the Slack page
-   Please read the syllabus on your own time

## Muddiest Points

### 1. Relationship between distributions

Just to clarify! We will be using the distributions in the context of hypothesis testing. I just wanted you to see some of the cool connections between the distributions. (We don't need to know the connections for a lot of what we do in this class.)

Also, I will discuss each distribution again as we hit the hypothesis tests that use them!

There is a big, scary (but fun!) infographic at the end of a famous stat textbook (Casella and Berger) that shows all the connections between distributions:

![](week_01/CB_distributions.png)

We mostly talk about the red, circled area. Each line with the directional arrow represents a specific transformation that is needed to go from the starting distribution to the distribution at the end of the arrow.

**Again, this is NOT information we need to perform regression, but it is really interesting to see the connections between these distributions.**

### 2. A word about the distributions

I feel like I might've scared us with all the distribution talk.

I want to be clear: We will further discuss and explore the distributions as we use them within the course. It will be more important **to understand their use within regression** then knowing the distribution in depth. **Basically, when we implement specific hypothesis tests, we just need to know which distribution is most appropriate for the test.**

### 3. Is the F distribution used for things outside of ANOVA?

Yes! In regression, we often use the F-distribution through the F-test (same as ANOVA) However, in regression, we are comparing the variance of two models, that may differ by a coefficient. [See the STAT 501 page for more info if interested.](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/6/6.2) In ANOVA, we are comparing variance between and within groups. Both use the same test, but with different goals!

### 4. Multivariable vs multivariate?

Some people misuse "multivariate" instead of "multivariable" modeling. In this class, we will only look at multivariable regression. Here's the big difference:

-   **Multivariable:** model with **multiple independent variables** (covariates, predictors)
    -   If we want to see how our outcome (height) is related to parent height, birth country, sex assigned at birth, etc.
-   **Multivariate:** model with **multiple dependent variables** (outcome)
    -   If we want to extend the outcome from height to height and head circumference. Multivariate modeling would try to model both outcomes together and see how they are related to other variables.

### 5. More on the functions and problems we had in class!

#### `mutate()`

coming soon

#### pipe `%>%`

coming soon

#### `select()` everything but a certain variable

coming soon

#### `pivot_longer()` the negative sign that appears before variables that you're managing in pivot_longer and one other time

coming soon

#### `across()`

coming soon

#### `tbl_summary()`: Trying to figure out how to change the median values to mean

Oh, wow! Turns out we solved it in class, but I made big mistake with my slides. The code for the table was in two places, but we fixed the one that was NOT running and showing on the slide!

So turns out, it worked!!

Here's the code:

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)  ## Need to load to use selec() and %>%
library(gtsummary)  ## Needed package for tbl_summary()

data("dds.discr")

dds.discr1 = dds.discr %>% 
  rename(SAB = gender, 
         R_E = ethnicity)

dds.discr1 %>%
  select(-id, -age.cohort) %>%
  tbl_summary(label = c(age ~ "Age", 
                        R_E ~ "Race/Ethnicity", 
                        SAB ~ "Sex Assigned at Birth", 
                        expenditures ~ "Expenditures") ,
              statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})"))
```

### 6. Are there benefits to ggplot compared to the base R graphing functions?

The main benefit I see for `ggplot` is that the syntax and grammar of our coding in `tidyr` and `dplyr` is very similar to `ggplot`. Your effort in strengthening one will help with the others.

I am certainly not going to force you to use `ggplot` over base R. At the end of the day, it is really whatever makes the most sense to you. I will say: `ggplot2` seems to be where most statisticians and epidemiologists are headed. And I really believe that `ggplot` is more efficient with coding.
