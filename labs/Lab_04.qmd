### Purpose

The main purpose of this lab is to perform model selection, identify one or more potential final models, and start our interpretation of our main relationship. 

### Grading

**This lab is graded out of 12 points.** Nicky will use the following rubric to assign grades.

## Lab activities

Before starting this lab, you should go back to Lab 2, save a new `.rda` file that contains all the new variables from that Lab. Then you can load it here!

### Restate your research question

::: callout-important
##### Task

Please restate your research question below using the provided format. It's repetitive, but it helps me contextualize my feedback as I look through your lab.
:::

### Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis

::: callout-important
#### Tasks

1.  Run a simple linear regression model for each covariate against the IAT score (outcome).
2.  Display results from the test if each covariate explains enough variation of the outcome. This may be from three options in the instructions: `summary()/anova()` only, `lapply()`, or `sapply()`

Interpretation of the results will be in the next step.
:::

### Step 2: Preliminary variable selection

::: callout-important
#### Tasks

1.    Decide which covariates will be included in the initial model and list them. 
2.    Run the initial model and display the regression table.

No need to write out the model, but you may *in addition* to the list. 
:::

### Step 3: Assess change in coefficient

::: callout-important
#### Tasks

Remove variables from the initial model based on your common sense, change in coefficient, and/or p-values of the F-tests.

**You do NOT need to show all your work here.** You just need to include: 

1.    A brief explanation of what variables were dropped and why (a sentence per variable), and
2.    An example of your process with one variable is enough (including code that you ran)
:::

### Step 4: Assess scale for continuous variables

::: callout-important
#### Tasks

No tasks here! If you want to try out what I did above, you can!
:::

### Step 5: Check for interactions

Task will be added shortly.
