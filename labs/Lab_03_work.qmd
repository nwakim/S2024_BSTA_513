### Purpose

The main purpose of this lab is to introduce our dataset, codebook, and variables. We will continue to think about the context of our research question, but our main focus is to become familiar with the data.

### Grading

**This lab is graded out of 12 points.** Nicky will use the following rubric to assign grades.
