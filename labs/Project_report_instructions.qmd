## Directions

### Purpose

Project reports serve as a great way to communicate the knowledge learned in a statistics class and connect it to context within research. It is important that we can take a step back from the numbers and analysis to see what questions linear regression can help us answer.

### Formatting guide

-   The report will be written in Quarto. Turn in both the `qmd` and `html` files
    -   No code should appear in the `html` document
        -   This means all R code chunks should have `#| echo: false`
-   The report should be 10 - 14 paragraphs long
-   Tables and figures should NOT have variable names as they appear in the data frame
    -   Variable names should be understood by a reader
    -   Variable names should be written in full words
    -   Include a title or caption for all figures
    -   Figure and tables appear on same page or close to same page where they are first referenced
-   Writing, spelling, and grammar should be admissable
    -   This means I can generally follow your thought/what you are trying to communicate
    -   Some spelling and grammar mistakes are allowed
        -   I will not take off points if there are a few sprinkled in
        -   If *every or close to every* sentence has mistakes, then I will take off
-   Sectioning of the report
    -   Main sections that were required: Introduction, Statistical Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References
    -   Other sections that might help group specific methods or results
-   Title information at the top of the `html`
    -   This includes the title itself, your name, and the date

::: callout-note
#### The project report is a separate file from the labs

You can save tables and figures from labs or separate files, then load them in the report

-   Save R objects in analyses file:
    -   Suppose you named the Table 1 as `table1`

    -   `save(table1, file = "table1.Rdata")`
-   Load R objects in report file: `load(file = "table1.Rdata")`

### Examples of reports

The following are examples of reports from BSTA 513 with the feedback that I gave them. Please note that 513 uses a different type of outcome than our class. These examples are meant to help guide you with the formatting and some appropriate content.

-   Report 1 html with my feedback in PDF

-   Report 2 html with my feedback in PDF

### Grading

The project report is out of 40 points. Note that the Statistical Methods and Results sections are graded on an 8-point scale, while all other components are graded on a 4-point scale.

## Sections

### Title

-   **Purpose:** Create an identifiable name for your research project that includes the main research question's variables and gives some context to the analysis or results

### Introduction

-   **Length: 1-2 paragraphs**
-   **Purpose:** Introduce the research question and why it is important to study
-   This section is non-technical.
    -   By reading just the introduction and conclusion, someone without a technical background should have an idea of what they study was about, why it is important, and what the main results are
-   You may start with the introduction written in Lab 1, but you should edit it and make sure it flows into your report well!
-   Should contain some references

### Statistical Methods

-   **Length: 3-5 paragraphs**
-   **Purpose:** Describe the analyses that were conducted and methods used to select variables and check diagnostics
-   **Important to keep in mind:** methods typically describe your approach and process, not the results of that process
    -   For example: I might say "We investigated the linearity of each continuous covariate visually. If continuous variables were not linear, then we divided the variable into categories using existing guidelines from \<insert reference here\> or creating quartiles."
        -   In the methods section, I would NOT say: "We investigated the linearity of each continuous covariate visually. We found that age was not linearly related to IAT scores. Thus, we categorized age into the following groups: \_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_."
            -   The last two sentences about age would be more appropriate in the Results section
-   **Some important methods to discuss** (You may divide these into your sections, not necessarily with these names)
    -   General approach to the dataset
        -   3-5 sentences
        -   Did you need to do any quality control?
        -   Missing data: we performed complete case analysis
            -   1 sentence
            -   Can be included in the Exploratory data analysis section
    -   Variables and variable creation
        -   This includes a description of analyses for Table 1 and what statistics were used to summarize the variables
            -   More on creation of Table 1, not discussing the results of Table 1
        -   Includes (not required)
            -   Indicators for gender identity or race
            -   Creating BMI

        -   Includes
            -   Describe purposeful selection: combining existing literature, clinical significance, and analysis
            -   How did you build the model? Describe the process

        -   Includes
            -   Process of investigating model diagnostics
            -   By the time you build the model, LINE assumptions should be met
            -   If assumptions were not met, what process did you use to fix it?

### Results

-   **Length: \~3 paragraphs**
-   **Purpose:** Relay the results from our sample's analysis typically focusing on the numbers and interpretations
-   Some important results to discuss (also could be sections)
    -   Sample data set statistics (Table 1)
        -   3-5 sentences
        -   Include a brief description of the sample’s characteristics
        -   Table 1 should be referenced and appear here!
    -   Final model
        -   Describe final model (or models if comparing a few)
            -   What variables were included in your final model?
            -   What interactions with your explanatory variable did you include?
    -   Interpret the model coefficients in the context of the research question
        -   1-2 paragraphs
    -   Results of model diagnostics if there is anything worth noting
-   Tables & figures
    -   The following are required tables or figures
        -   Table 1 summarizing participant characteristics both **overall** and **stratified by your primary independent variable**
        -   Table or figure with regression results
            -   Can be a forest plot
    -   **1-3 figures that you think are helpful in understanding the results, for example**
        -   DAG explaining connection between variables (if you did this)
        -   Table or figure to compare model fit statistics (if you did this)
        -   Table or figure for unadjusted relationship between outcome and explanatory variables

### Discussion

-   **Length: 2-3 paragraphs**
-   **Purpose:** Discuss the results and give them context outside of the sample and its analysis
-   Some important things to include
    -   Include a paragraph on the limitations of the results
    -   Any overarching trends that are worth noting?
-   Should contain some references

### Conclusion

-   **Length: 1 short paragraph (more like \~3 sentences)**
-   **Purpose:** Describe the main conclusions to a non-technical audience

### References

-   Include your references here!
-   You introduction should have references, especially when discussing the social science behind the analysis
