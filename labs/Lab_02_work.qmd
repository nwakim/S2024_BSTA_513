## Directions

Please turn in your `.html` file [on Sakai.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-512-1-AB-W24/tool/961ec5ef-d7f9-4518-be16-25f7af3d6be4?panel=Main) Please let me know if you greatly prefer to submit a physical copy. We can work out another way for you to turn in homework.

The rest of this lab's instructions are embedded into the lab activities.

### Purpose

The main purpose of this lab is to introduce our dataset, codebook, and variables. We will continue to think about the context of our research question, but our main focus is to become familiar with the data.

### Grading

This lab is graded out of 12 points. Nicky will use the following rubric to assign grades.

## Lab activities

### 1. Access and download the data

This serves as good practice for accessing data that is online or needs to be downloaded from a collaborator.

Data can be accessed [here](https://osf.io/iay3x/). Under "Weight IAT 2004-2022" there are several drop down menus:

![](images/data_access_1.png)

I opened the first "Datasets & Codebooks," then selected "OSF Storage (United States)." Once selected, the "Download as zip" option pops up in the top right part of the Files section.

![](images/data_access_2.png)

We will be working with the `Weight_IAT.public.2021.csv` dataset. Please locate the `zip` file called `Weight IAT.public.2021-CSV.zip` . T0 download, you need to click the row of the zip file, but you can't click the name of the zip file. If a link opens, then you clicked the name. If the row is highlighted blue and clickable "Download" and "View" buttons appear on the top right, then you selected it correctly! (See below image for what it should look like.)

![](images/data_access_3.png)

Then click the "Download" button to download! Note that the name does not have an underscore between "Weight" and "IAT." I like to have my datasets named without spaces, so I will replace the space with an underscore.

For the codebook, perform the same process for the file named: `Weight_IAT_public_2021_codebook.xlsx`

You will need to unzip the actual data.

Move the data to a folder that you can easily access as you work from this document. I like to have a folder named `data` to house my data.

### 2. Load data and needed packages

First, load the packages that you will need in the remainder of this lab. You can add to this as you need to. At the top of your R code chunk, you can add the following option to repress the messages from the loading packages:

![](images/r_message.png)

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
library(here)
```

Using R, load the data (`csv` file) into this document. Note that this is a `csv` file that we can load with basic R packages. Name your dataset something that feels intuitive to you and will distinguish it from other datasets that you work with.

```{r}
iat_2021_raw = read.csv(file = here("labs", "data", "Weight_IAT.public.2021.csv"))
```

Take a glimpse at the data to make sure you loaded it correctly.

```{r}
glimpse(iat_2021_raw)
```

How many rows and columns are in the dataset? Do you think we will need all these variables for our analysis?

### 3. Data wrangling

#### 3.1 Restrict your analysis to 1 outcome and 10 possible covariates/predictors

#### 3.1 Manipulating variables that are coded as numeric variables

#### 3.2 Converting categorical variables to continuous variables

#### 3.3 Make a new dataset with only complete cases

Quickly make sure that we are not introducing bias by using complete cases

### 4. Some exploratory data analysis

4.1 Peek at your outcome

This serves as a check to make sure we are all looking at the correct outcome: IAT score. Please plot a histogram of the IAT scores.

#### 4.1 Univariate exploratory data analysis

#### 4.2 Bivariate exploratory data analysis

#### 4.3 Multivariate exploratory data analysis

### 5. Revisit your research question

Please restate the research question that you proposed in Lab 1. What are your thoughts on the research question now that we looked at the data?

### 5. Make a Table 1
