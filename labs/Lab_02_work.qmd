The rest of this lab's instructions are embedded into the lab activities.

### Purpose

The main purpose of this lab is to introduce our dataset, codebook, and variables. We will continue to think about the context of our research question, but our main focus is to become familiar with the data.

### Grading

This lab is graded out of 12 points. Nicky will use the following rubric to assign grades.

## Lab activities

### 1. Access and download the data

This serves as good practice for accessing data that is online or needs to be downloaded from a collaborator.

Data can be accessed [here](https://osf.io/iay3x/). Under "Weight IAT 2004-2022" there are several drop down menus:

![](images/data_access_1.png)

I opened the first "Datasets & Codebooks," then selected "OSF Storage (United States)." Once selected, the "Download as zip" option pops up in the top right part of the Files section.

![](images/data_access_2.png)

We will be working with the `Weight_IAT.public.2021.csv` dataset. Please locate the `zip` file called `Weight IAT.public.2021-CSV.zip` . T0 download, you need to click the row of the zip file, but you can't click the name of the zip file. If a link opens, then you clicked the name. If the row is highlighted blue and clickable "Download" and "View" buttons appear on the top right, then you selected it correctly! (See below image for what it should look like.)

![](images/data_access_3.png)

Then click the "Download" button to download! Note that the name does not have an underscore between "Weight" and "IAT." I like to have my datasets named without spaces, so I will replace the space with an underscore.

For the codebook, perform the same process for the file named: `Weight_IAT_public_2021_codebook.xlsx`

You will need to unzip the actual data.

Move the data to a folder that you can easily access as you work from this document. I like to have a folder named `data` to house my data.

### 2. Load data and needed packages

First, load the packages that you will need in the remainder of this lab. You can add to this as you need to. At the top of your R code chunk, you can add the following option to repress the messages from the loading packages:

![](images/r_message.png)

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
library(here)
```

Using R, load the data (`csv` file) into this document. Note that this is a `csv` file that we can load with basic R packages. Name your dataset something that feels intuitive to you and will distinguish it from other datasets that you work with.

```{r}
iat_2021_raw = read.csv(file = here("../TA_files/Project/data/Weight_IAT.public.2021.csv"))
```

Loading the `csv` file every time you render will take a long time. One way to speed this up is by saving the data as an `rda` file (R data file). Change the following R code to save the `rda` file. You will also need to remove the `#| eval: false` at the top of the code chunk once you have corrected the code. If you are confused on the syntax, don't forget that you can use `?save` for more information.

```{r}
#| eval: false
save(<whatever you called the read csv file>, file = "Where you would like to save the file with its name")
```

Check that you have an `rda` file where you save it. Now use `load()` with the file path to load the `rda` data here.

```{r}
#| eval: false
load(file = "Where you would like to save the file with its name")
```

At this point, if you think you loaded the file correctly, add `#| eval: false` to the code chunk where you loaded the `csv` file and back to the chunk where you saved the `rda` file.

Take a glimpse at the data to make sure you loaded it correctly. This should be able to run with just the code chunk with your `load()` command.

```{r}
glimpse(iat_2021_raw)
```

How many rows and columns are in the dataset? Do you think we will need all these variables for our analysis?

### 3. Data wrangling

As you go through this process, it is important that you look at the codebook for more information on each variable.

#### 3.1 What's our target population?

As many of you mentioned in Lab 1, individuals taking the IAT test are not necessarily representative of the world population. I want you to articulate the target population that you think our analysis can give information about. To what population can we generalize our analysis results? We can get very specific with this population, but try to restrict your population to 3-5 characteristics.

After you articulate the population, I want to add one more restriction to our population: US residency. The sample includes individuals residing in many different countries. Since we are discussing attitudes and beliefs that are connected to our society, I think it is important that we restrict our analysis and discussion to a country that we have some social experience in. Thus, let's restrict our data to the US only by filtering the variable `countryres` to category 1 (corresponding to the US).

#### 3.1 Restrict your analysis to 1 outcome and 10 possible covariates/predictors

We are going to restrict our analysis to the single outcome, IAT score, which is named `D_biep.Thin_Good_all`.

We will also restrict our analysis to the following 10 potential variables so our work is a little more manageable.

From the following 7 attitudes and beliefs, please select 3 that you think will be the most important variables related to your research question. In 1-2 lines, briefly explain why you chose each variable. This can be informal and bulleted.

(Make sure you chose the variable that is part of your research question!)

1.  Self-perception of weight (`iam_001`)
2.  Fat group identity (`identfat_001` )
3.  Thin group identity (`identthen_001` )
4.  Controllability of weight of others (`controlother_001`)
5.  Controllability of weight of yourself (`controlyou_001`)
6.  Awareness of societal standards (`mostpref_001` )
7.  Internalization of societal standards (`important_001`)

We will start our data exploration with the following 4 demographic variables:

1.  Age
2.  Race
3.  Ethnicity
4.  Gender

You may pick 3 additional variables to include in your analysis:

1.  Education
2.  Sex assigned at birth
3.  Self-reported BMI
4.  Political identity
5.  Religion

I have chosen these variables for a mixture of reasons. For example, I have left out variables about residence and occuptation because those variables have hundreds of categories that would be overwhelming in linear regression. For the 4 required demographic variables, I chose age because I really want us to get practice with a continuous variable. I chose race and ethnicity because of the intertwined history of racism and anti-fat bias in the Western countries (including the U.S. where most participants reside). Finally, I chose gender because diet culture has historically targeted genders in different ways.

If you would like to investigate a variable outside the list, please let me know by emailing or chatting with me.

Using R, select your identified variables from your dataset. Your new dataset should have 11 columns for the 11 variables.

#### 3.1 Manipulating variables that are coded as numeric variables

#### 3.2 Converting categorical variables to continuous variables

#### 3.3 Make a new dataset with only complete cases

Quickly make sure that we are not introducing bias by using complete cases

### 4. Some exploratory data analysis

4.1 Peek at your outcome

This serves as a check to make sure we are all looking at the correct outcome: IAT score. Please plot a histogram of the IAT scores.

#### 4.1 Univariate exploratory data analysis

#### 4.2 Bivariate exploratory data analysis

#### 4.3 Multivariate exploratory data analysis

### 5. Revisit your research question

Please restate the research question that you proposed in Lab 1. What are your thoughts on the research question now that we looked at the data?

### 5. Make a Table 1
