\subsection{Description}\label{description}}

Welcome to BSTA 513/613! In this course, we will continue to learn about
regression analysis, but not with categorical outcomes. We will build
some theoretical understanding in order to interpret and apply logistic
regression models appropriately. We will learn how to build a logistic
regression model, interpret the model and coefficients, and diagnose
potential issues with our model.

\hypertarget{course-learning-objectives}{%
\subsubsection{Course Learning
Objectives}\label{course-learning-objectives}}

At the end of this course, students should be able to\ldots{}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Apply and interpret a variety of hypothesis-testing procedures for
  two-way and three-way contingency tables
\item
  Compute and interpret measures of association for binary and ordinal
  data.
\item
  Calculate and correctly interpret odds ratios using logistic
  regression, make comparison across groups and examine relationship
  between binary outcome and predictor variables.
\item
  Apply appropriate model-building strategies for logistic regression.
  Effectively use statistical computing packages for contingency table
  and logistic regression procedures.
\item
  Perform Poisson regression analysis using count data and interpret
  model estimates, make comparison across groups and examine
  relationship between outcome and predictor variables.
\item
  Coherently summarize methods and results of data analyses, and discuss
  in context of original health-related research questions to audiences
  with varied statistical background.
\end{enumerate}

These learning objectives were adapted from

\hypertarget{online-resources}{%
\subsubsection{Online Resources}\label{online-resources}}

\hypertarget{slack}{%
\paragraph{Slack}\label{slack}}

We will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If
you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions,
please ask me by posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that
Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question
about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me
via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on
Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.

\href{https://join.slack.com/t/slack-xvk6383/shared_invite/zt-29g7biioz-XhPs~tj8xwL1GajEw9YlTg}{**Please
use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**}

\textbf{Tips on asking questions:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some
  context on what you have already tried.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For example, including a photo of your work thus far with an
    explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for
    me to look over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me
    see what parts you already understand and which you need help with.
    If your question involves code, please \textbf{include the copied
    code (not a screenshot)} and an attachment to your full file. This
    way I can see the exact line you need help with and the full code in
    case the problem starts earlier.
  \item
    If you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes
    and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When
    reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be
    helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.
  \item
    If you only write something similar to ``I don't know how to do
    problem xxx,'' then my response will be to ask you what you tried so
    far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this
    information right away.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If asking for help about a specific example that you don't understand,
  please also provide some detail beyond ``I don't understand example
  xxx.''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Which steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a
    line number, for example.
  \item
    If you don't understand the first step, do you understand the ones
    following it?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number
  it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it's an
  example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will
  help finding it.
\item
  Want more tips on asking questions? This list on
  \href{https://www.weareteachers.com/8-ways-to-pose-better-questions-in-math-class/}{this
  site} will help!
\item
  Finally, if I don't respond within a day and you need a response soon,
  \emph{please remind me by emailing or messaging me again}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sakai}{%
\paragraph{Sakai}\label{sakai}}

While most course materials will be delivered online through this
website, assignments will be turned in through
\href{https://sakai.ohsu.edu/}{Sakai}, OHSU's course management system.
I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page.~

\hypertarget{explain-everything}{%
\paragraph{Explain Everything}\label{explain-everything}}

I plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This
application allows me to take real-time notes, access Poll Everywhere,
and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to
follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous
viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to
you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I
understand that life events get in the way of in-person attendance, but
your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further
motivates me to be a great teacher.~

\hypertarget{webex}{%
\paragraph{Webex}\label{webex}}

Webex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone
the best possible experience with Webex, I recommend the following best
practices:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Please stay muted until you want to participate
\item
  During office hours, please send a message in chat with your question
  or with a statement like ``I have a question.'' This makes sure I or
  the TA can address everyone's questions in order.~
\item
  I encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps
  me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I
  emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding.~
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{poll-everywhere}{%
\paragraph{Poll Everywhere}\label{poll-everywhere}}

We will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the
course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students
to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page
on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions
will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the
presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use
this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your
phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before
our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make
an account.~

During lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are
designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the
instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant
to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your
grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I
encourage you to answer honestly.

\hypertarget{pennstate-stat-501-website}{%
\paragraph{PennState STAT 501
Website}\label{pennstate-stat-501-website}}

PennState has a class offered to online MS students that has some
overlap with our class. They have all their
\href{https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/}{course notes posted on this
page}. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with
different phrasing.

Not all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important
ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course's concepts on
their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a
private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under
our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills
involving resources and learning key words that can help you find
answers.~

\hypertarget{r-statistical-computing-software}{%
\paragraph{R: Statistical Computing
Software}\label{r-statistical-computing-software}}

Students will use statistical software to complete homework assignments.
Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely
downloaded.
\href{https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html}{Helpful
documentation} on installing R is available. \textbf{I encourage you to
install R prior to attending our first lecture.} Please email me if you
need help installing R or RStudio.

You will need to download the following three things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  R \url{https://www.r-project.org/}
\item
  Rstudio \url{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}
\item

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{additional-r-resources}{%
\subparagraph{Additional R Resources}\label{additional-r-resources}}

Your learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this
course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many
resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional
resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in
R.

\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Modality} & \textbf{Frequency} &
\textbf{Description} \\
Lecture & In person & Twice, Weekly & Course content is provided through
in-person lectures. Lectures will consist of didactic lessons,
interactive examples, and PollEverywhere questions. Sessions will be
recorded through Explain Everything and posted to Sakai.
\textbf{Attending or viewing the lecture within 7 days of the original
lecture date is mandatory.} Class attendance will be taken through an
Exit Ticket. If viewing the lecture asynchronously, you must take the
Exit Ticket to verify your attendance. \\
Homework & Online & Weekly & The course includes 7 homework assignments.
They are an opportunity for you to engage with important concepts,
practice coding, and apply calculating skills. Homework assignments
should be submitted online, and will be graded by me. Students are
encouraged to work in groups for homework assignments, but each person
should do their own summary and hand in their work. \textbf{Homework
assignments will be due on Thursday at 11 PM.} \\
Quizzes & In person & Every 3 weeks & The purpose of the quizzes is to
assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through
questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes,
and interpreting output. \textbf{We will have our quizzes in-class, and
it will be open book.} Students must work on the quizzes
independently. \\
Project (Labs and Report) & Online & 4 labs, 1 final report & The
project will be a combination of submitted labs that will span the
quarter and one final report submitted at the end of the quarter. This
is meant to translate the tools learned in the course to the work one
may do in the workforce. This will help instill the procedure for
shaping research goals, model selection, analyzing data, and
interpreting meaningful results. Labs will guide you through the needed
analysis and background for the project. The final report will summarize
your work over the labs and more closely align with a journal article.
Students will work independently on each lab. \\

\hypertarget{types-of-assessments}{%
\paragraph{Types of assessments}\label{types-of-assessments}}

This class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments
to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of
assessments:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Formative assessment:} Activity or work meant to help students
  learn and practice. Feedback on these assessments are meant to help
  the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight
  accomplishments.
\item
  \textbf{Summative assessment:} Work meant to test how well students
  have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are
  meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and
  will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{assessment-breakdown}{%

B- (82-80\%), C+(78-79\%), C(73-77\%), C- (70-72\%), D (60 -- 69\%),
F(\textless60\%).

Grades will be based on homework assignments, midterm exam, class
``attendance'', and final exam, as follows:

\hypertarget{homework-grading}{%
\subsubsection{Homework grading}\label{homework-grading}}

No student has the same amount of time available to dedicate to
homework. This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking
several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other
activities. Homeworks are \textbf{formative assessments}, meaning its
purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you
to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading
policy: \textbf{Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn
something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong).} I
highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as
much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this
class!

After the due date, the TAs will give you feedback (on one or more
complete problems) and post the solutions.

Sakai. Students can submit feedback at any time and this form will be
reviewed regularly by me. Your responses will be anonymous unless you
elect to leave your email address. If I have done anything to make you
feel uncomfortable, please give me feedback so I can change my behavior.
\textbf{Ultimately, this class is for you, and my individual social
identity/behavior should not inhibit your learning.} Thank you for your
help making BSTA 512/612 a more successful class! Examples of ongoing
feedback are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Nicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?
\item
  During Office Hours, Dr.~Wakim made a face when I asked a question.
  This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.
\item
  Dr.~W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a
  monolith. Please do not assume I can speak on behalf of my social
  identity groups.
\item
  The in-class examples do not make me more interested in the material.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{mid-quarter-feedback}{%
\subsubsection{Mid-quarter Feedback}\label{mid-quarter-feedback}}

During the middle of the quarter, I will ask you to submit guided,

grade. To insure anonymity, I will ask you to sign a separate, written
statement that you completed the feedback.

\hypertarget{final-course-feedback}{%
\subsubsection{Final Course Feedback}\label{final-course-feedback}}

At the conclusion of the course, you will be asked to complete a formal
online review of the course and the instructor. Your feedback on this
University evaluation is critical to improving future student learning
in this course as well as providing metrics relevant to the instructor's
career advancement (or lack of). Since our class is on the smaller side,
everyone's participation is needed for feedback to be released.

\hypertarget{schedule}{%
\subsection{Schedule}\label{schedule}}

\href{/schedule1.qmd}{Please refer to the Schedule page.} I will make
changes to this schedule if we need more or less time on a concept. You
do not need to read the corresponding chapters in the textbook for each
class.

\subsection{How to succeed in this
course}\label{how-to-succeed-in-this-course}}

Every professor has different expectations when assigning certain work
or providing certain resources. I want to walk through each class
resource and assignment so that you know what you can do to succeed in
\emph{this class}. For resources, I want you to optimize the
opportunities to learn. For assignments, I want you to know the
strategies that students can use to learn the most and prepare for
future exams.

\textbf{Resource} & \textbf{What is it?} & \textbf{How do I use it?} \\
Office Hours & Blocks of time a professor or TA dedicates for questions.
The teaching staff will be located in a specific room. Several students
may enter the space at a time and will ask specific or broad questions.
If many students attend office hours, a queue will be created so that
students can be served equally. & The main use of office hours is to ask
questions about an assignment or lecture notes. You are welcome to sit
and do homework in office hours. OH are also an informal way of meeting
fellow students to collaborate with. \\
Lectures and lecture recordings & Time shared between the professor and
students where the professor conveys important class material. Material
discussed in lectures include concepts, calculations, code, and
examples. Lectures are a mix of presentation of information, working
through examples together, interactive activities, and in-class polls. &
Students should attend lectures in person if possible. You should
attempt to understand new material presented by following the
presentation slides, taking notes on additional details that may
conveyed verbally, and working through examples with the professor.
Students are encouraged to ask questions when you don't understand the
material at any point in the lecture. \\
Textbooks & Written and published material that explains concepts, steps
through calculations, provides examples, and provides practice problems.
The listed textbooks is the basis for this course. While I am to cover
all topics in class, the textbook provides alternative explanations and
additional examples. & While coming to class having read the
accompanying textbook chapters helps understanding during class, I do
not expect students to have read it. I see the textbook as a good
resource if you are struggling with a specific topic after class, in
need of an example while working on homework, or want additional
practice when studying for the exam. \\
Website & The course website is designed by me so that you have access
to all the course materials in a more organized and flexible way. All
resources delivered from me to you will be available on the website. Any
assignments turned in will be through Sakai. & You can navigate through
different course resources and information using the left-side tabs or
top navigation bar. Course materials, like lecture notes, homework, data
examples, and recordings, can be found under each week's page under the
schedule tab. You can also find the individual resources under the
``Course Materials'' tab on the left. Links to turn in assignments
through Sakai will be given on the website. Please explore the tabs and
get a sense of the organization. \\
Sakai & Sakai is a learning management system for higher ed.~This is the
university sanctioned LMS where we will submit assignments. & You will
turn in assignments through Sakai under the ``Submissions'' tab.
Generally, there will be a link to each assignment on the course
website. You can also view your grades under ``Gradebook'' and links to
Webex under ``Webex.'' \\

\subsubsection{Late Work Policy}\label{late-work-policy}}

I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on
time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control.
Please see this
\href{https://myuni.swansea.ac.uk/academic-life/extenuating-circumstances/\#how-can-the-university-support-me-and-what-should-i-do=is-expanded\&what-are-extenuating-circumstances=is-expanded\&what-isnt-an-extenuating-circumstance=is-expanded\&what-supporting-evidence-is-required=is-expanded\&who-should-i-contact-to-make-an-extenuating-circumstances-application=is-expanded\&who-will-make-a-decision-on-my-application=is-expanded}{Swansea
University's page on extenuating circumstances} for some examples. Not
all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have
questions.~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The class will end on March 22, 2024. \textbf{All coursework is
  expected to be completed by then.} If you have \emph{extenuating
  circumstances}, and need additional time to complete class
  assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan
  for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.
\item
  If you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability
  to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with
  a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in
  your education.
\item
  For homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the
  assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check
  regardless of when you submit the assignment. \textbf{However, if you
  would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR
  email me asking for feedback for your late homework.}
\item
  For non-homework assignments, including labs, I ask you to email me
  directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an
  extension, but I won't necessarily grant one.
\item
  For labs, you will have ONE no-questions-asked, 3-day extension.
  Please use this wisely! You just need to send me a quick email saying
  ``I am using my no-questions-asked extension for Lab \_\_.''
\item
  If you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend,
  classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not
  worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after
  your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only
  because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are
  able.~
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{regrade-policy}{%
\subsubsection{Regrade Policy}\label{regrade-policy}}

If you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your
answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be
appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short
explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded.
Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late
requests will not be considered).

\hypertarget{attendance-policy}{%
\subsubsection{Attendance Policy}\label{attendance-policy}}

You are expected to attend class, participate in-class polls, and
complete the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review,
I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are
no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording
availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class
in-person and synchronously, \textbf{viewing the recording within 7
days} is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the
course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit
ticket to demonstrate attendance.

\hypertarget{plagiarism-and-attribution}{%
\subsubsection{Plagiarism and
Attribution}\label{plagiarism-and-attribution}}

Please note that this section has been motivated by
\href{https://dmice.ohsu.edu/bedricks/courses/bmi525/policies.html}{Dr.~Steven
Bedrick's Course Policies and Grading site} for BMI 525. (Note that this
is a good example of informal attribution of someone else's work.)

In this class, it is easy to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to solve your
homework for you. Many problems follow a basic structure that is
especially easy for ChatGPT to solve. In this class, you may use ChatGPT
to help with your homework. You may even ask for direct answers.
However, there are a few things I do not want you to do:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Do not copy ChatGPT's answer directly into your homework.}
  Your homework is graded for full credit if you turn it in, in any
  state, so turning in ChatGPT's answers is unacceptable. I rather see
  half-written answers that show what you're thinking than see a correct
  answer from ChatGPT.
\item
  \textbf{Do not stop once ChatGPT answered a question.} If it gives an
  explanation, interact with it! Make sure you understand the thought
  process of ChatGPT. Try writing out the process to help cement it in
  your head. Check the answer with what we learn in class.
\item
  \textbf{Do not use ChatGPT on our quizzes!} Hence, you need to really
  understand how to solve these problems even if you use ChatGPT on the
  homework.
\end{itemize}

At the end of the day, ChatGPT is a resource that will be available to
you in a job and outside of school. Thus, we should use it as a tool in
school as well! Let me know if ChatGPT helped you understand something!
I would love to incorporate it into future classes!

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, bottomrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, toprule=.15mm, opacityback=0, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-important-color!10!white, breakable, titlerule=0mm, left=2mm, colframe=quarto-callout-important-color-frame, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-important-color}{\faExclamation}\hspace{0.5em}{Important}, leftrule=.75mm, bottomtitle=1mm, arc=.35mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white]

You can think of this class as assembling a toolbox. When a handyperson
starts working for the first time, they need to buy their tools. For
their first few jobs, they might need help finding their tools, or
remembering which tool is best used for what action. Eventually, they
get to know their tools well, and using them appropriately becomes
second nature.

\textbf{For now, ChatGPT can help us find and use our tools, but we need
to work towards using them as second nature!}

\subsubsection{Instructor Expectations}\label{instructor-expectations}}

\ul{\emph{Commitment to your learning and your success\\
}}I believe that everyone has the ability to be successful in this
course and I have put a lot of effort into designing the course in a way
that maximizes your learning to ensure your success. Please talk to me
before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want
to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of
your learning and growth.

\ul{\emph{Inclusive \& supportive learning community}}\\
I believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a
community. This means creating a space characterized by generous
listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt
to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple
cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a
classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and
express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.

\ul{\emph{Openness to feedback}}\\
I appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the
class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or
when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is
not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or
stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously
improve. Please also let me know if there's an aspect of the class you
find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!

\ul{\emph{Responsiveness\\
}}I will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try
respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.

\ul{\emph{Clear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments}}\\
I will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading
rubric when applicable. I will provide detailed feedback on your
submissions and will update grades promptly in Sakai.

\hypertarget{student-expectations-and-resources}{%
\subsubsection{Student Expectations and
Resources}\label{student-expectations-and-resources}}

\ul{\emph{Attend class}}\textbf{\hfill\break
}You are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings synchronously
or watch the recording within 7 days. Attendance is taken through exit
tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please
let me know.~

\ul{\emph{Participate\textbf{\hfill\break
}}}I encourage you to participate actively in class and online
discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be
respectful of each other's contributions, whether I agree with them or
not. Professional interactions are expected.

\ul{\emph{Build rapport}}\\
If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or
other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as
possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships
are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are
proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the quarter so
that I can help you find a solution.

\ul{\emph{Complete assignments}}\\
All assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through
Sakai unless otherwise instructed.~ I encourage you to make your best
effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that
sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need
an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.

\ul{\emph{Seek help if you need it}}\textbf{\hfill\break
}I believe it is important to support the physical and emotional
well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental
health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as
those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your
performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help
connecting with these resources, please contact me.

  \href{https://www.pdx.edu/health-counseling/}{Website}, 503-725-2800
\end{itemize}

\ul{\emph{Inform your instructor of any accommodations needed}}\\
You should speak with or email me before or during the first week of
classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic
accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the
School policies below.

Some religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days.
Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to
hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available
and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the
regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with
questions from the session.

\ul{\emph{Commit to integrity}}\textbf{\hfill\break
}As a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to
maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning
and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in
and out of the classroom.

Cheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in
this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct
refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments,
fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents,
intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library
materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts.
Preparation of exams, assigned on an individual basis, must represent
each student's own individual effort. When used, resource materials
should be cited in conventional reference format.

\hypertarget{course-communications}{%
\subsection{Course Communications}\label{course-communications}}

\textbf{Sakai/Slack announcements\\
}For important/urgent matters, I will communicate with you using
announcements via Sakai that will be delivered to your OHSU Email
account as well as displayed in the Sakai course site Announcements
section. I will copy these announcements in Slack if they do not involve
changes to the schedule. Unfortunately, there are certain announcements
that OHSU requires I initiate behind the firewall.

\textbf{General course questions\\
}It is normal to have many questions about things that relate to the
course, such as clarification about assignments, course materials, or
assessments. Please post these on our Slack Workspace. Please use the
channels that I created for questions. You are encouraged to give
answers and help each other. I will monitor these threads, so I will
endorse or correct responses as needed. Please give me 24 hours to
respond to questions within Monday-Friday. Work-life balance is
important for me as well, so I will try to respond as quickly as I can
within my healthy limits.~

\textbf{E-mail}\\
E-mail should be used only for messages that are private in nature.
Please send private messages to my OHSU email address (wakim@ohsu.edu).
\textbf{Messages sent through Sakai Inbox will not be answered.} Do not
send messages asking general information about the class; please post
those on Slack instead.
