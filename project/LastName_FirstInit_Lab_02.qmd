## Directions

### Grading

**This lab is graded out of 12 points.** The TAs will go through and grade your lab. They will make sure each section is complete and will follow the rubric below. I have instructed them that completion and clear effort is all that is needed to receive 100%. Nicky will go through the labs to give you feedback.
