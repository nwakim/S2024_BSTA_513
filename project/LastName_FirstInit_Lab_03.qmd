## Directions

This is your **editing** file. **Please do not remove anything from this editing file!!** You will only add your code and work to this file.

### Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to explore our data further, set up the unadjusted odds ratio, and create code to later help us present our final model.

### Grading

**This lab is graded out of 12 points.** The TAs will go through and grade your lab. They will make sure each section is complete and will follow the rubric below. I have instructed them that completion and clear effort is all that is needed to receive 100%. Nicky will go through the labs to give you feedback.

## Lab activities

::: callout-note
I have left it up to you to load the needed packages for this lab.
:::

### Restate research question

::: callout-important
#### Task

Please restate your research question below using the provided format (1 sentence). You can change the wording if you'd like, but please make sure it is still clear. Itâ€™s repetitive, but it helps me contextualize my feedback as I look through your lab.
:::

In this study, we will investigate the association between food insecurity and ________. 


### Make sure variables are coded correctly

::: callout-important
#### Task

-   Use `class()` to determine the class of each of the 11 variables you selected from Lab 1 (including the outcome).
-   Change the variable type to the appropriate type.
:::

### Consider potential confounders and effect modifiers

::: callout-important
#### Task

Fill in the below table (or any other way you wish to present the same information).
:::


| Variable name | Confounder, Effect modifier, or nothing? | Reasoning (1-2 sentences) |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|               |                                          |                           |

### Create contingency tables for categorical predictors

::: callout-important
#### Task
-   Create contingency tables for all categorical covariates with food insecurity.
-   Take note of any cell counts that are less than 10
:::

### Bivariate exploratory data analysis

::: callout-important
#### Task

-   Use `ggpairs()` ([introduced in BSTA 512 Lesson 13](https://nwakim.github.io/W2024_BSTA_512/slides/13_Purposeful_Selection.html#/pre-step-step-1-explore-simple-relationships-and-assumptions)) to quickly look at the relationship between variables.
-   List predictors with which there is a clear trend with food insecurity.
:::


### Fit simple logistic regression

::: callout-important
#### Task
-   Using `glm()`, run a logistic regression with food insecurity and your main variable of interest. 
-   Display the unadjusted odds ratio of the regression. You can use `logistic.display()`
-   Interpret the unadjusted odds ratio (with 95% confidence interval). If you're main variable is multi-level, then you will need to interpret multiple odds ratios.
:::

### Plot the predicted probability

::: callout-important
#### Task

Plot or make a table of your predicted probabilities.
