Nahhas\n\nSpecifically Chapter 6\n\n\n\nSupplemental Readings (Optional)\n\nAn Introduction to R (free pdf available)\n\n\n\n\nOnline Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask me by posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\nTips on asking questions:\n\nWhen reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.\n\nFor example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with. If your question involves code, please include the copied code (not a screenshot) and an attachment to your full file. This way I can see the exact line you need help with and the full code in case the problem starts earlier.\nIf you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.\nIf you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.\n\nIf asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”\n\nWhich steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.\nIf you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?\n\nIn general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.\nWant more tips on asking questions? This list on this site will help!\nFinally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, please remind me by emailing or messaging me again.\n\n\n\nSakai\nWhile most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, I recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 504 Website\nPennState has a class offered to online MS students that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on this page. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R.

Lectures will consist of didactic lessons, interactive examples, and PollEverywhere questions. Sessions will be recorded through Explain Everything and posted to Sakai. Attending or viewing the lecture within 7 days of the original lecture date is mandatory. Class attendance will be taken through an Exit Ticket. If viewing the lecture asynchronously, you must take the Exit Ticket to verify your attendance.\n\n\nHomework\nOnline\nWeekly\nThe course includes 7 homework assignments. They are an opportunity for you to engage with important concepts, practice coding, and apply calculating skills. Homework assignments should be submitted online, and will be graded by me. Students are encouraged to work in groups for homework assignments, but each person should do their own summary and hand in their work. Homework assignments will be due on Thursday at 11 PM.\n\n\nQuizzes\nIn person\nEvery 3 weeks\nThe purpose of the quizzes is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our quizzes in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the quizzes independently.\n\n\nProject (Labs and Report)\nOnline\n4 labs, 1 final report\nThe project will be a combination of submitted labs that will span the quarter and one final report submitted at the end of the quarter. This is meant to translate the tools learned in the course to the work one may do in the workforce. This will help instill the procedure for shaping research goals, model selection, analyzing data, and interpreting meaningful results. Labs will guide you through the needed analysis and background for the project. The final report will summarize your work over the labs and more closely align with a journal article. Students will work independently on each lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Feedback on these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom."

This form will be available on Sakai. Students can submit feedback at any time and this form will be reviewed regularly by me. Your responses will be anonymous unless you elect to leave your email address. If I have done anything to make you feel uncomfortable, please give me feedback so I can change my behavior. Ultimately, this class is for you, and my individual social identity/behavior should not inhibit your learning. Thank you for your help making BSTA 513/613 a more successful class! Examples of ongoing feedback are:\n\nNicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?\nDuring Office Hours, Dr. Wakim made a face when I asked a question. This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.\nDr. W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a monolith. Please do not assume I can speak on behalf of my social identity groups.\nThe in-class examples do not make me more interested in the material.\n\n\n\nMid-quarter Feedback\nDuring the middle of the quarter, I will ask you to submit guided, anonymous feedback. Completion of feedback will be count towards your grade. To insure anonymity, I will ask you to sign a separate, written statement that you completed the feedback.\n\n\nFinal Course Feedback\nAt the conclusion of the course, you will be asked to complete a formal online review of the course and the instructor. Your feedback on this University evaluation is critical to improving future student learning in this course as well as providing metrics relevant to the instructor’s career advancement (or lack of). Since our class is on the smaller side, everyone’s participation is needed for feedback to be released."

    "text": "How to succeed in this course\nEvery professor has different expectations when assigning certain work or providing certain resources. I want to walk through each class resource and assignment so that you know what you can do to succeed in this class. For resources, I want you to optimize the opportunities to learn. For assignments, I want you to know the strategies that students can use to learn the most and prepare for future exams.\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nWhat is it?\nHow do I use it?\n\n\nOffice Hours\nBlocks of time a professor or TA dedicates for questions. The teaching staff will be located in a specific room. Several students may enter the space at a time and will ask specific or broad questions. If many students attend office hours, a queue will be created so that students can be served equally.\nThe main use of office hours is to ask questions about an assignment or lecture notes. You are welcome to sit and do homework in office hours. OH are also an informal way of meeting fellow students to collaborate with.\n\n\nLectures and lecture recordings\nTime shared between the professor and students where the professor conveys important class material. Material discussed in lectures include concepts, calculations, code, and examples. Lectures are a mix of presentation of information, working through examples together, interactive activities, and in-class polls.\nStudents should attend lectures in person if possible. You should attempt to understand new material presented by following the presentation slides, taking notes on additional details that may conveyed verbally, and working through examples with the professor. Students are encouraged to ask questions when you don’t understand the material at any point in the lecture.\n\n\nTextbooks\nWritten and published material that explains concepts, steps through calculations, provides examples, and provides practice problems. The listed textbooks is the basis for this course. While I am to cover all topics in class, the textbook provides alternative explanations and additional examples.\nWhile coming to class having read the accompanying textbook chapters helps understanding during class, I do not expect students to have read it. I see the textbook as a good resource if you are struggling with a specific topic after class, in need of an example while working on homework, or want additional practice when studying for the exam.\n\n\nWebsite\nThe course website is designed by me so that you have access to all the course materials in a more organized and flexible way. All resources delivered from me to you will be available on the website. Any assignments turned in will be through Sakai.\nYou can navigate through different course resources and information using the left-side tabs or top navigation bar. Course materials, like lecture notes, homework, data examples, and recordings, can be found under each week’s page under the schedule tab. You can also find the individual resources under the “Course Materials” tab on the left. Links to turn in assignments through Sakai will be given on the website. Please explore the tabs and get a sense of the organization.\n\n\nSakai\nSakai is a learning management system for higher ed. This is the university sanctioned LMS where we will submit assignments.\nYou will turn in assignments through Sakai under the “Submissions” tab. Generally, there will be a link to each assignment on the course website. You can also view your grades under “Gradebook” and links to Webex under “Webex.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nType of assessment\nBefore you submit/take it\nAfter it is graded\n\n\nHomework\nFormative\n\nWork out each problem on your own as much as you can\nTalk through problems with a peer\nGo to Office Hours for help\nWrite down work that shows your thought process\nSearch your issue on Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow\n\n\nReview the solutions\nReview your mistakes\nFor solutions that involve writing sentences, check with me or a TA if your answer fits the solution\nGo to Office Hours to ask about your solutions\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nSummative\n\nIdentify and achieve learning objectives in each lecture\nUnderstand why certain statistics tools are used for certain cases\nPractice testing yourself and others on concepts\nCome to Office Hours for help with specific problems or concepts\n\n\nReview the solutions\nReview your mistakes\nFor solutions that involve writing sentences, check with me or a TA if your answer fits the solution\nGo to Office Hours to ask about your solutions\nDo not ask for a regrade unless you have viewed the solutions\n\n\n\nProject Labs and Report\nFormative and Summtive\n\nStart the lab as early as possible\nWork on R coding and check with classmates on work\nCome to Office Hours for help with specific R work\nFor the report, compile your work from the labs, and decide what is important in the analysis.\n\n\nThis will be graded at the end of the semester, so you will not have a chance to interact with my feedback as much\nIf you have questions about your grade, you may email me\nKeep the project paper for future reference\nYou can add this project to your resume!\n\n\n\nClass Exit Tickets\nN/A\n\nBring appropriate electronic device to participate in polls\nComplete the survey during the last 5 minutes of class or after class within 7 days\n\n\nReview muddiest and clearest points from the week\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like any other course resources explained in this format, please request it through the Ongoing Course Feedback."

Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nThe class will end on March 22, 2024. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.\nFor non-homework assignments, including labs, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nFor labs, you will have ONE no-questions-asked, 3-day extension. Please use this wisely! You just need to send me a quick email saying “I am using my no-questions-asked extension for Lab __.”\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class, participate in-class polls, and complete the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance.\n\n\nPlagiarism and Attribution\nPlease note that this section has been motivated by Dr. Steven Bedrick’s Course Policies and Grading site for BMI 525. (Note that this is a good example of informal attribution of someone else’s work.)\nIn this class, it is easy to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to solve your homework for you. Many problems follow a basic structure that is especially easy for ChatGPT to solve. In this class, you may use ChatGPT to help with your homework. You may even ask for direct answers. However, there are a few things I do not want you to do:\n\nDo not copy ChatGPT’s answer directly into your homework. Your homework is graded for full credit if you turn it in, in any state, so turning in ChatGPT’s answers is unacceptable. I rather see half-written answers that show what you’re thinking than see a correct answer from ChatGPT.\nDo not stop once ChatGPT answered a question. If it gives an explanation, interact with it! Make sure you understand the thought process of ChatGPT. Try writing out the process to help cement it in your head. Check the answer with what we learn in class.\nDo not use ChatGPT on our quizzes! Hence, you need to really understand how to solve these problems even if you use ChatGPT on the homework.\n\nAt the end of the day, ChatGPT is a resource that will be available to you in a job and outside of school. Thus, we should use it as a tool in school as well! Let me know if ChatGPT helped you understand something! I would love to incorporate it into future classes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can think of this class as assembling a toolbox. When a handyperson starts working for the first time, they need to buy their tools. For their first few jobs, they might need help finding their tools, or remembering which tool is best used for what action. Eventually, they get to know their tools well, and using them appropriately becomes second nature.\nFor now, ChatGPT can help us find and use our tools, but we need to work towards using them as second nature!"

Please talk to me before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of your learning and growth.\nInclusive & supportive learning community\nI believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.\nOpenness to feedback\nI appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!\nResponsiveness\nI will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.\nClear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments\nI will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading rubric when applicable. I will provide detailed feedback on your submissions and will update grades promptly in Sakai.\n\n\nStudent Expectations and Resources\nAttend class\nYou are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings synchronously or watch the recording within 7 days. Attendance is taken through exit tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please let me know. \nParticipate\nI encourage you to participate actively in class and online discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.\nBuild rapport\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the quarter so that I can help you find a solution.\nComplete assignments\nAll assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.  I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.\nSeek help if you need it\nI believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact me.\n\nStudent Health and Wellness Center (SHW), Website, 503-494-8665 (OHSU Students only)\nStudent Health and Counseling (SHAC), Website, 503-725-2800\n\nInform your instructor of any accommodations needed\nYou should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.\nSome religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.\nCommit to integrity\nAs a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.\nCheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of exams, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format."

    "section": "Question 2",
    "text": "Question 2\nI was intrigued by the results from Question 1, so I started researching the relationship between contraception and MI. In a journal review article, the authors present smoking status as a potential confounder for the relationship between OC use and MI. In Table 2 of their paper, they present various risk ratios for smoking and nonsmoking women. Use the below tables, that are recreated from one study’s data, to answer the following questions.\nNonsmokers:\n\n\nWarning: 'tidy.numeric' is deprecated.\nSee help(\"Deprecated\")\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 1\n  x[,\"Yes\"] [,\"No\"]\n      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        36     317\n2        72     521\n\n\nSmokers:\n\n\nWarning: 'tidy.numeric' is deprecated.\nSee help(\"Deprecated\")\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 1\n  x[,\"Yes\"] [,\"No\"]\n      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       210     416\n2       236     586\n\n\n\nPart a\nCompute the stratum-specific ORs for each smoking status. Present the estimates with 95% Confidence interval.\n\n\nPart b\nIs it appropriate to compute the smoking-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio for OC vs. non-OC users? Explain your reasoning. You may choose to perform the Breslow-Day test only if you want to explore a new topic. Otherwise, use sentences to explain your general reasoning.\nIf you answered yes, then estimate the value with its 95% confidence interval.\n\n\nAside (not a homework problem)\nIf you are interested in a short review of the relationship between oral contraceptive pills (OCP) and MI, see this article abstract. I cannot find the full article online, so if you find it, please pass along. The abstract states:\n\nAlthough OCP doses were subsequently reduced, epidemiologic evidence continued to support a smaller, but significant association between OCPs and hypertension.\n\nThis single statement packs in some interesting aspects of the research process and influences from society. To start, the OCP doses were reduced from their initial approval. However, the early studies (1980s-90s) that link increased risk of hypertension and MI to OCs were still some of the first articles presented in my Google search. You may also find it interesting to think about how the perception of contraception has changed since the 1980s, and how societal views can impact research questions."

My name is Becky Lanford. I’m looking forward to helping support you in your coursework this quarter. A little about my background: I am currently in my final year in the MPH Epidemiology track and have completed most of my coursework including the biostatistics and epidemiology series (mostly working in R). I enrolled at the SPH as someone re-entering the workforce and quite new to statistical programming. Though I had previously completed a graduate degree (as a Physician Assistant/Associate), re-acclimating to graduate work and learning programming skills made for a steep learning curve my first academic year. I credit the collaborative learning environment at SPH - support of TA’s and classmates and availability of instructors - for helping me be successful. I hope I can help answer course-content questions, problem solve with you and find answers if I don’t have them myself. I know there are many challenges to being a graduate student and I am excited to help our public health student community grow stronger and more knowledgeable together."
