Nahhas\n\nSpecifically Chapter 6\n\n\n\nSupplemental Readings (Optional)\n\nAn Introduction to R (free pdf available)\n\n\n\n\nOnline Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask me by posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\nTips on asking questions:\n\nWhen reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.\n\nFor example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with. If your question involves code, please include the copied code (not a screenshot) and an attachment to your full file. This way I can see the exact line you need help with and the full code in case the problem starts earlier.\nIf you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.\nIf you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.\n\nIf asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”\n\nWhich steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.\nIf you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?\n\nIn general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.\nWant more tips on asking questions? This list on this site will help!\nFinally, if I don’t respond within a day and you need a response soon, please remind me by emailing or messaging me again.\n\n\n\nSakai\nWhile most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through Sakai, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page. \n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, I recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order. \nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding. \n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account. \nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 504 Website\nPennState has a class offered to online MS students that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on this page. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers. \n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R.

Lectures will consist of didactic lessons, interactive examples, and PollEverywhere questions. Sessions will be recorded through Explain Everything and posted to Sakai. Attending or viewing the lecture within 7 days of the original lecture date is mandatory. Class attendance will be taken through an Exit Ticket. If viewing the lecture asynchronously, you must take the Exit Ticket to verify your attendance.\n\n\nHomework\nOnline\nWeekly\nThe course includes 7 homework assignments. They are an opportunity for you to engage with important concepts, practice coding, and apply calculating skills. Homework assignments should be submitted online, and will be graded by me. Students are encouraged to work in groups for homework assignments, but each person should do their own summary and hand in their work. Homework assignments will be due on Thursday at 11 PM.\n\n\nQuizzes\nIn person\nEvery 3 weeks\nThe purpose of the quizzes is to assess how well you have achieved the learning objectives through questions covering important concepts, conducting statistical processes, and interpreting output. We will have our quizzes in-class, and it will be open book. Students must work on the quizzes independently.\n\n\nProject (Labs and Report)\nOnline\n4 labs, 1 final report\nThe project will be a combination of submitted labs that will span the quarter and one final report submitted at the end of the quarter. This is meant to translate the tools learned in the course to the work one may do in the workforce. This will help instill the procedure for shaping research goals, model selection, analyzing data, and interpreting meaningful results. Labs will guide you through the needed analysis and background for the project. The final report will summarize your work over the labs and more closely align with a journal article. Students will work independently on each lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Feedback on these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom."

This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn in 50% of the questions parts completed (whether the 50% is correct or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nIf you turn in the homework on time, the TAs will give you feedback (on one or more complete problems). There is no penalty for turning in the homework late, but you will not get feedback on your work. Please make sure to check the solutions or go to office hours to assess your work.\n\n\nLab grading\nWhile these are formative assignments, it is important to complete the whole lab and put in your best effort. Points will be deducted based on the rubric if it is clear that effort is not made or tasks are skipped.\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points."

This form will be available on Sakai. Students can submit feedback at any time and this form will be reviewed regularly by me. Your responses will be anonymous unless you elect to leave your email address. If I have done anything to make you feel uncomfortable, please give me feedback so I can change my behavior. Ultimately, this class is for you, and my individual social identity/behavior should not inhibit your learning. Thank you for your help making BSTA 513/613 a more successful class! Examples of ongoing feedback are:\n\nNicky talks a little fast during lecture time. May you speak slower?\nDuring Office Hours, Dr. Wakim made a face when I asked a question. This face made me feel self-conscious about my question.\nDr. W asked me a question about my experience that made me feel like a monolith. Please do not assume I can speak on behalf of my social identity groups.\nThe in-class examples do not make me more interested in the material.\n\n\n\nMid-quarter Feedback\nDuring the middle of the quarter, I will ask you to submit guided, anonymous feedback. Completion of feedback will be count towards your grade. To insure anonymity, I will ask you to sign a separate, written statement that you completed the feedback.\n\n\nFinal Course Feedback\nAt the conclusion of the course, you will be asked to complete a formal online review of the course and the instructor. Your feedback on this University evaluation is critical to improving future student learning in this course as well as providing metrics relevant to the instructor’s career advancement (or lack of). Since our class is on the smaller side, everyone’s participation is needed for feedback to be released."

    "text": "How to succeed in this course\nEvery professor has different expectations when assigning certain work or providing certain resources. I want to walk through each class resource and assignment so that you know what you can do to succeed in this class. For resources, I want you to optimize the opportunities to learn. For assignments, I want you to know the strategies that students can use to learn the most and prepare for future exams.\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource\nWhat is it?\nHow do I use it?\n\n\nOffice Hours\nBlocks of time a professor or TA dedicates for questions. The teaching staff will be located in a specific room. Several students may enter the space at a time and will ask specific or broad questions. If many students attend office hours, a queue will be created so that students can be served equally.\nThe main use of office hours is to ask questions about an assignment or lecture notes. You are welcome to sit and do homework in office hours. OH are also an informal way of meeting fellow students to collaborate with.\n\n\nLectures and lecture recordings\nTime shared between the professor and students where the professor conveys important class material. Material discussed in lectures include concepts, calculations, code, and examples. Lectures are a mix of presentation of information, working through examples together, interactive activities, and in-class polls.\nStudents should attend lectures in person if possible. You should attempt to understand new material presented by following the presentation slides, taking notes on additional details that may conveyed verbally, and working through examples with the professor. Students are encouraged to ask questions when you don’t understand the material at any point in the lecture.\n\n\nTextbooks\nWritten and published material that explains concepts, steps through calculations, provides examples, and provides practice problems. The listed textbooks is the basis for this course. While I am to cover all topics in class, the textbook provides alternative explanations and additional examples.\nWhile coming to class having read the accompanying textbook chapters helps understanding during class, I do not expect students to have read it. I see the textbook as a good resource if you are struggling with a specific topic after class, in need of an example while working on homework, or want additional practice when studying for the exam.\n\n\nWebsite\nThe course website is designed by me so that you have access to all the course materials in a more organized and flexible way. All resources delivered from me to you will be available on the website. Any assignments turned in will be through Sakai.\nYou can navigate through different course resources and information using the left-side tabs or top navigation bar. Course materials, like lecture notes, homework, data examples, and recordings, can be found under each week’s page under the schedule tab. You can also find the individual resources under the “Course Materials” tab on the left. Links to turn in assignments through Sakai will be given on the website. Please explore the tabs and get a sense of the organization.\n\n\nSakai\nSakai is a learning management system for higher ed. This is the university sanctioned LMS where we will submit assignments.\nYou will turn in assignments through Sakai under the “Submissions” tab. Generally, there will be a link to each assignment on the course website.

Please see this Swansea University’s page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions. \n\nThe class will end on March 22, 2024. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.\nFor non-homework assignments, including labs, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.\nFor labs, you will have ONE no-questions-asked, 3-day extension. Please use this wisely! You just need to send me a quick email saying “I am using my no-questions-asked extension for Lab __.”\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able. \n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class, participate in-class polls, and complete the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance.\n\n\nPlagiarism and Attribution\nPlease note that this section has been motivated by Dr. Steven Bedrick’s Course Policies and Grading site for BMI 525. (Note that this is a good example of informal attribution of someone else’s work.)\nIn this class, it is easy to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to solve your homework for you. Many problems follow a basic structure that is especially easy for ChatGPT to solve. In this class, you may use ChatGPT to help with your homework. You may even ask for direct answers. However, there are a few things I do not want you to do:\n\nDo not copy ChatGPT’s answer directly into your homework. Your homework is graded for full credit if you turn it in, in any state, so turning in ChatGPT’s answers is unacceptable. I rather see half-written answers that show what you’re thinking than see a correct answer from ChatGPT.\nDo not stop once ChatGPT answered a question. If it gives an explanation, interact with it! Make sure you understand the thought process of ChatGPT. Try writing out the process to help cement it in your head. Check the answer with what we learn in class.\nDo not use ChatGPT on our quizzes! Hence, you need to really understand how to solve these problems even if you use ChatGPT on the homework.\n\nAt the end of the day, ChatGPT is a resource that will be available to you in a job and outside of school. Thus, we should use it as a tool in school as well! Let me know if ChatGPT helped you understand something! I would love to incorporate it into future classes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can think of this class as assembling a toolbox. When a handyperson starts working for the first time, they need to buy their tools. For their first few jobs, they might need help finding their tools, or remembering which tool is best used for what action. Eventually, they get to know their tools well, and using them appropriately becomes second nature.\nFor now, ChatGPT can help us find and use our tools, but we need to work towards using them as second nature!"

Please talk to me before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of your learning and growth.\nInclusive & supportive learning community\nI believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.\nOpenness to feedback\nI appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!\nResponsiveness\nI will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.\nClear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments\nI will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading rubric when applicable. I will provide detailed feedback on your submissions and will update grades promptly in Sakai.\n\n\nStudent Expectations and Resources\nAttend class\nYou are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings synchronously or watch the recording within 7 days. Attendance is taken through exit tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please let me know. \nParticipate\nI encourage you to participate actively in class and online discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.\nBuild rapport\nIf you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the quarter so that I can help you find a solution.\nComplete assignments\nAll assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.  I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.\nSeek help if you need it\nI believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact me.\n\nStudent Health and Wellness Center (SHW), Website, 503-494-8665 (OHSU Students only)\nStudent Health and Counseling (SHAC), Website, 503-725-2800\n\nInform your instructor of any accommodations needed\nYou should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.\nSome religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.\nCommit to integrity\nAs a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.\nCheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of exams, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format."

    "text": "Questions\n\nQuestion 1\nThis question is adapted from the Hosmer and Lemeshow textbook. Use the ICU data described in Section 1.6.1 (pg. 22 of textbook) and consider the multiple logistic regression model of vital status, STA, on age (AGE), cancer part of the present problem (CAN), CPR prior to ICU admission (CPR), infection probable at ICU admission (INF), and race (RACE).\n\n\nPart a\nFrom the above list (AGE, CAN, CPR, INF, and RACE) of independent variables, identify if each is a continuous, binary, or multi-group (&gt;2) categorical variable.\n\n\nPart b\nFor the binary and multi-group categorical variables, please identify the reference groups for each. Include justification for the reference group. (You may need to go to the textbook, pg. 23, to see what each variable is.)\n\n\nPart c\nWrite down the equation for the logistic regression model of STA on AGE, CAN, CPR, INF, and RACE. How many parameters does this model contain?\n\n\nPart d\nFor the categorical variables (binary and multi-group), please mutate the variables within the ICU dataset to set your chosen reference groups. Do the same for the outcome variable. (Right now these variables are coded as text, not factors, so we first need to make them factors, then assign them levels. For STA, you may do the same coding from Homework 3. Hint: look into function factor() in the pre-loaded base package.)\n\n\nPart e\nUsing glm(), obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the logistic regression model in Part c. Using these estimates write down the equation for the fitted values (i.e., the estimated logistic probabilities).\n\n\nPart f\nAssess the significance of the group of coefficients for all variables in the model using the likelihood ratio test. (Hint: part of the ratio in the LRT will be an intercept only model) What is the value of the deviance for the fitted model?\n\n\nPart g\nFit a new model using only AGE and CPR as the predictors. Write a sentence interpreting the odds ratio for both variables. Please include the 95% confidence interval.\n\n\nPart h\nFor age, compute 95% confidence intervals for a the estimated odds ratio for a 10 year increase. Write a sentence interpreting the odds ratio for the 10-year increase.\n\n\nPart i\nCompute the predicted probability for a subject who is 63 years old and did not receive CPR before being admitted to the ICU. Compute the 95% confidence interval for the predicted probability and interpret the predicted probability."

In this class, we will heavily use the function glm(). By typing “?glm” in the R console, we can open the Help page for glm(). The following questions ask about the glm() function. You can Google or use R documentation to answer the questions.\nFeel free to read more about the differences between lm() and glm().\n\nPart a\nWhat does the input “family” mean? If I wanted to perform regression using a Poisson distribution, what would I input into family?\n\n\nPart b\nWhat is the default action for the “na.action” input?\n\n\nPart c\nHow does the glm() function fit our model? (Hint: see “method”)\n\n\nPart d\nDo you think the output of summary() will be the same for lm() and glm()?"

Explain why or why not.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nOne important aspect of medical diagnosis is its reproducibility. Suppose that two different doctors examine 100 patients for dyspnea in a respiratory-disease clinic, and that doctor A diagnosed 15 patients as having dyspnea (while doctor B did not), doctor B diagnosed 10 patients as having dyspnea (while doctor A did not), and both doctor A and doctor B diagnosed 7 patients as having dyspnea.\n\nPart a\nConstruct a two-way contingency table to summarize the dyspnea diagnoses from doctor A and B.\n\n\nPart b\nCompute the Cohen’s kappa, 95% confidence interval, and interpret the results. What level of agreement does your kappa indicate?\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\nThis question is meant to emphasize the differences between linear regression and logistic regression. Each part will ask about different aspects of the two regression models. If the question has multiple choice answers, then you must write 1-2 sentences justifying your answer.\n\nPart a\nIn linear regression, what type of variable is our response/outcome variable?\n\nbinary\ncontinuous\ncount\nordinal\n\n\n\nPart b\nIn logistic regression, what type of variable is our response/outcome variable?\n\nbinary\ncontinuous\ncount\nnormal\n\n\n\nPart c\nWhat assumptions in linear regression?

You may choose more than one answer.\n\nOrdinary least squares\nMaximum likelihood estimation\n\n\n\nPart i\nHow do we determine our coefficient estimates (estimates of the parameter values) in logistic regression? You may choose more than one answer.\n\nOrdinary least squares\nMaximum likelihood estimation\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\nThis question is taken from the Hosmer and Lemeshow textbook. The ICU study data set consists of a sample of 200 subjects who were part of a much larger study on survival of patients following admission to an adult intensive care unit (ICU). The datset should be available within Coure Materials. The major goal of this study was to develop a logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival to hospital discharge of these patients. In this question, the primary outcome variable is vital status at hospital discharge, STA. Clinicians associated with the study felt that a key determinant of survival was the patient’s age at admission, AGE.\nA code sheet for the variables to be considered is displayed in Table 1.5 below (from the Hosmer and Lemeshow textbook, pg. 23). We refer to this data set as the ICU data.\n\n\nPart a\nWrite down the equation for the logistic regression model of STA on AGE. What characteristic of the outcome variable, STA, leads us to consider the logistic regression model as opposed to the usual linear regression model to describe the relationship between STA and AGE?\n\n\nPart b\nWrite down an expression for the log-likelihood for the logistic regression model in Part a. This will me a mathematical expression. Please do not use generic expressions like \\(\\pi(X)\\), instead replace \\(X\\) with the specific variables in this question.\n\n\nPart c\nUsing the glm() function, obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficient parameters of the logistic regression model in Part a. Using these estimates, write down fitted logistic regression model.\n\n\nPart d\nUse the Wald test to test whether or not the intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) of the logistic regression model is significantly different from 0. Make sure to include your: hypothesis test, code/work leading to the computed test statistic, output including the test statistic and p-value, and conclusion. Please refer to the Additional Tips to guide you on what a complete/correct answer contains.\n\n\nPart e\nUse the Likelihood Ratio test to test whether or not the coefficient for age (\\(\\beta_1\\)) of the logistic regression model is significantly different from 0. Make sure to include your: hypothesis test, code/work leading to the computed test statistic, output including the test statistic and p-value, and conclusion. Please refer to the Additional Tips to guide you on what a complete/correct answer contains. You do not need to include an interpretation of the coefficient since we have not covered this."

    "text": "Question 2\nI was intrigued by the results from Question 1, so I started researching the relationship between contraception and MI. In a journal review article, the authors present smoking status as a potential confounder for the relationship between OC use and MI.

You may choose to perform the Breslow-Day test only if you want to explore a new topic. Otherwise, use sentences to explain your general reasoning.\nIf you answered yes, then estimate the value with its 95% confidence interval.\n\n\nAside (not a homework problem)\nIf you are interested in a short review of the relationship between oral contraceptive pills (OCP) and MI, see this article abstract. I cannot find the full article online, so if you find it, please pass along. The abstract states:\n\nAlthough OCP doses were subsequently reduced, epidemiologic evidence continued to support a smaller, but significant association between OCPs and hypertension.\n\nThis single statement packs in some interesting aspects of the research process and influences from society. To start, the OCP doses were reduced from their initial approval. However, the early studies (1980s-90s) that link increased risk of hypertension and MI to OCs were still some of the first articles presented in my Google search. You may also find it interesting to think about how the perception of contraception has changed since the 1980s, and how societal views can impact research questions."

It comes down to more of an English language nuance, with what seems to be a long battle between viewpoints. Or maybe more accurately, I grammatically correct way to contruct the sentence, but with people understanding the meaning the “incorrect” way. I tend to be more lenient when it comes to grammar in this way, but maybe that’s because I have a general distaste when languages are rigid and don’t accommodate how people currently speak and write.\n\n\n2. For the relative risks poll everywhere question #2, how were they derived?\n\nFor #1 with Trt A’s risk as 0.01 (aka \\(risk_A=0.01\\)) and Trt B’s risk as 0.001 (aka \\(risk_B=0.01\\))\n\nThe risk ratio is: \\(\\widehat{RR} = \\dfrac{\\widehat{p}_1}{\\widehat{p}_2} = \\dfrac{risk_A}{risk_B} = \\dfrac{0.01}{0.001} = 10\\)\n\nFor #2 with Trt A’s risk as 0.41 (aka \\(risk_A=0.41\\)) and Trt B’s risk as 0.401 (aka \\(risk_B=0.401\\))\n\nThe risk ratio is: \\(\\widehat{RR} = \\dfrac{\\widehat{p}_1}{\\widehat{p}_2} = \\dfrac{risk_A}{risk_B} = \\dfrac{0.41}{0.401} = 1.02\\)\n\n\n\n\n3. Ranges that odds ratios can take (0, infinity) vs the ranges that risk ratios can take.\nYeah, so both can theoretically take on the range \\([0, \\infty)\\). Both are ratios, so we also have to think about the range of the denominator and numerator For relative risk, the numerator and denominator are probabilities that can only take values from 0 to 1. While for ORs, the denominator and numerator are odds that can be a range of values \\([0, \\infty)\\).\nThe main point I was trying to make was that once we observe one group’s proportion/probability, then RRs and ORs will differ in their potential range. Let’s say I observe the proportion fro group 1 and now know the numerator for RR and the odds in the numerator for OR. Because the RR has numerator and denominator that has ranges \\([0, 1]\\), if we know the proportion of group 1 (aka numerator value), then the ratio itself has a smaller range of values because the denominator can only be between 0 and 1. Because the OR has numerator and denominator that has ranges \\([0, \\infty)\\), if we know the proportion of group 1, then we do have a fixed numerator. However, the denominator can still be in \\([0, \\infty)\\).\n\n\n4. For the odds ratio equation that we reviewed today, is it different from ad/bc ? If they are different, when is it appropriate to use the equation we just reviewed over the other? p1/(1-p1) / p2/(1-p2)\nNope! These are the same! If you learned it that way, you can definitely use it when we are working with contingency tables. However, once we move into ORs from regression with multiple covariates, I think it’s better to understand the ORs and odds in terms of the probability/proportion.\n\n\n5. Not directly related to this class, but did we cover LRTs already? They’re mentioned in HW1 but aren’t in my notes.\nOops! Fixed it in the HW. No need to do anything with LRTs!\n\n\n6. In Epi, we were very strictly told that Odds Ratios were only to be used in one type of study. (I.e. we CAN NOT use them in cross-sectional and cohort studies) only case-control. So what is the application of attempting to utilize them, if each respective type of study already has a “pre-assigned” statistical method that suits it best?\nOdds ratios CAN be used in cross-sectional AND cohort studies. It is often an over-estimate of the relative risk in those situations, so it is important to interpret it ONLY as the odds ratio.\nEach respective study does not have a pre-assigned method. The only restriction is that relative risk cannot be used in case-control studies."

My name is Becky Lanford. I’m looking forward to helping support you in your coursework this quarter. A little about my background: I am currently in my final year in the MPH Epidemiology track and have completed most of my coursework including the biostatistics and epidemiology series (mostly working in R). I enrolled at the SPH as someone re-entering the workforce and quite new to statistical programming. Though I had previously completed a graduate degree (as a Physician Assistant/Associate), re-acclimating to graduate work and learning programming skills made for a steep learning curve my first academic year. I credit the collaborative learning environment at SPH - support of TA’s and classmates and availability of instructors - for helping me be successful. I hope I can help answer course-content questions, problem solve with you and find answers if I don’t have them myself. I know there are many challenges to being a graduate student and I am excited to help our public health student community grow stronger and more knowledgeable together."

Here is a list of the tests we have covered:\n\nSingle proportion\nChi-squared test for general association\nFisher’s Exact test for general association\nCochran-Armitage test for trend\nMantel-Haenszel test for linear trend\n\nAnd here is a list of attributes to include:\n\nNumber of variables testing\nTypes of variables\nCriteria (if any)\nHypothesis test\nTest statistic (if we went over it)\nR code for test\nSample size / Power calculation (optional, not discussed in class)\nSpecial notes (optional)\n\nFor example, I could make a table with different rows corresponding to different tests and different columns for each attribute.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nI want you to gain experience exploring a package and function. This is an important skill in coding that can help you grow as an applied statistician.\nIn your previous course, the function lm() was introduced to perform linear regression. In this class, we will heavily use the function glm(). By typing “?glm” in the R console, we can open the Help page for glm(). The following questions ask about the glm() function. You can Google or use R documentation to answer the questions.\nFeel free to read more about the differences between lm() and glm().\n\nPart a\nWhat does the input “family” mean? If I wanted to perform regression using a Poisson distribution, what would I input into family?\n\n\nPart b\nWhat is the default action for the “na.action” input?\n\n\nPart c\nHow does the glm() function fit our model? (Hint: see “method”)\n\n\nPart d\nDo you think the output of summary() will be the same for lm() and glm()?\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\nOPTIONAL\nLet’s make a decision tree on the different tests we learned! I would like you to make a flow chart for the different tests we learned in Classes 1 and 2. You’ll need to include characteristics for:\n\nNumber of variables (1, 2, or 3 - we will go over 3 variables in Class 4)\nNumber of categories in each variable\nSample size is small\nOrdinal/nominal independent variable\nOrdinal/nominal response variable(s)\n\nFor example, if I make a decision tree that includes end nodes for different animals (cat, dog, snake, turtle, and hawk) using yes/no characteristics (has a shell, woof/meows, has fur, or flies), then my flow chart would look like: See my example under Sakai Resources. You are welcome to draw this chart. I used SmartArt under the Insert tab in Word to create mine."

I haven’t fully read them all yet, but I will be reading and sharing throughout the quarter.\nHere are some articles:\n\nNPR: Millions of American families struggle to get food on the table, report finds\n\nWith option to listen to article\n\nIdentification of factors related to food insecurity and the implications for social determinants of health screenings\nNIMHD’s page on Food Accessibility, Insecurity and Health Outcomes\nFood Insecurity among American Indians and Alaska Natives: A National Profile using the Current Population Survey–Food Security Supplement\nA Framework for Evaluating Social Determinants of Health Screening and Referrals for Assistance\n\n\n\n2.2 Familiarize yourself with the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey\nPlease read the Urban Institute’s page on the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey (WBNS) and more of their published information of the survey (at least the first 4 pages). You can also read about the overarching From Safety Net to Solid Ground Initiative that started the survey. Answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is the motivation for this study?\nHow could an analysis that looks at associations with food insecurity help facilitate change in policy?\nWhy is it important to study food insecurity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nAnswer the following questions using information on WBNS:\n\nWhat is the motivation for this study?\nHow could an analysis that looks at associations with food insecurity help facilitate change in policy?\nWhy is it important to study food insecurity?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 File organization\nBefore downloading the data, go back to Lesson 2 and follow the file setup for our project. This includes making an .Rproj file within the main folder. Make sure you are working with the project by using the here() function to display your working directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nDisplay your working directory using the here package and here() function.\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Access and download the data\n\nGo to the Health and Medical Care Archive page for the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey\nGo to the Data & Documentation tab \nDownload the R version of the Public use data \nRead and agree to the Terms of Use. After this, you will be redirected to a new page.\nLog into ICPSR by clicking “Access through your institution”. You should be taken to a new page where you need to select “Oregon Health & Science University” \nLogin using standard OHSU login. Then the download should begin!\nMake sure to move this into your project folder under the Data folder.\nTake a look at the folders/files you just downloaded. Make sure to locate and understand the difference between the Codebook, Questionnaire, and User Guide. (Note that the website also contains the codebook if you go to the variable tab. I think the online one has an easier user interface than the pdf.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nNo task to report back on. Just make sure you have the data!\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Decide on list of variables to focus on\nFrom the codebook, I want you to explore the variables and create a list of 10 predictors that you would like to focus on. Our outcome is FOOD_INSEC so we cannot use this as a predictor. Feel free to take a look at the Urban Institute’s list of publications to get ideas of variables and relationships.\nThere are a few requirements for your predictors:\n\n1 variable must be a numeric (i.e. PPAGE)\n1 variable must be binary\n1 variable must be multi-level categorical (categorical with more than 2 groups)\nYou must choose at least 10 predictors (does not include the outcome)\n\nThere is a good online version of the codebook with information about the variables. I have linked you to the ID varaible, but you can take a look at all the other variables using the left hand side navigator:\n\nYou can look under survey questions to get a better sense of how questions were asked, but please stick to variables under Demographic Variables, Family Income, Insurance Status, and Material Hardship. Do not choose variables from the Administrative levels, Survey Questions, nor School Enrollment or Child Care variables. May leave in the ID variable for easier tracking on individuals, but it does not count towards the 10 predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nList the 10 predictors that you plan to use in your analysis. Note which variables are numeric, binary, or multi-level categorical.\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Get a sense of how you would like to analyze the data\nFor our project, we will examine the association between the food insecurity and one other variable (our main explanatory variable). From the above readings, survey information, and your list of predictors in Section 2.5, which association are you most interested in analyzing?\nPlease write this in the form of a research question statement. Feel free to copy this sentence and insert your chosen predictor: We will investigate the association between food insecurity and ____.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nComplete the following statement to identify your research question:\nWe will investigate the association between food insecurity and ____.\n\n\n\n\n2.7 Save data for processing with .Rda\nWithin this document, or in a separate document, use R to save a copy of the dataset so that you can process it without changing the raw data. Recall the file organization that we discussed to set up proper folders. Include a screenshot showing the new .Rda file within your Data folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nInclude a screenshot showing the new .Rda file within your Data folder.\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Getting data in working format\nYou can start by selecting only the variables you will use in your analysis. Again, you can keep ID in addition to your outcome and predictors for easy tracking.\nUse the following code (with your dataset’s name) to remove the parentheses with values that are in front of the category names. Make sure to change old_df and new_df.\n\nnew_df = data.frame(lapply(old_df, function(x) {gsub(\".*) \", \"\", x)}))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\n\nSelect the variables that will be used in your analysis and make a new dataset. Include the code that you used.\nRemove the parentheses with values that are in front of the category names.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9 Explore the outcome and predictors\nThe codebook online gives some nice plots of each variable. Please take a look at the codebook online to see the spread of each variable. Make note of any categorical variables that have less than 100 observations in a group. This may cause issues in our analysis later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\n\nTo check that you have looked that the variables, please report the percent of respondents that were food insecure in the past 12 months.\nList any categorical variables that have less than 100 observations in a group\n\n\n\n\n\n2.10 Compile above work into an introduction\nPlease check out this source for what a research article introduction includes and how to organize it. The only thing I would add is mentioning the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nWrite an introduction to the analysis."

(Note that the parts are sited differently in the textbook.)\nUse the Myopia Study data described in Section 1.6.6 and use MYOPIC as the outcome and as possible variables for a model: AGE, GENDER, family history of myopia (MOMMY and DADMY), number of hours playing sports (SPORTHR) and number of hours watching television (TVHR).\n\nPart a\nWrite down the equation for the logistic regression model of MYOPIC on AGE, GENDER, MOMMY, DADMY, SPORTHR, and TVHR. How many parameters does this model contain?\n\n\nPart b\nUsing glm(), obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the logistic regression model. Using these estimates write down the equation for the fitted values (i.e., the estimated logistic probabilities).\n\n\nPart c\nAssess the significance of the coefficient corresponding to number of hours playing sports. You may use the Wald test or the likelihood ratio test. Please interpret the odds ratio for the coefficient (in this part, you do not need to calculate the confidence interval.)"
