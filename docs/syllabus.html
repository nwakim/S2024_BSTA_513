<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Welcome to BSTA 512/612! In this course, we will focus on linear models, and build our understanding of regression analysis. We will build some theoretical understanding in order to interpret and apply regression models appropriately. We will learn how to build a regression model, interpret the model, and diagnose potential issues with our model.</p>
<section id="course-learning-objectives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-learning-objectives">Course Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>At the end of this course, students should be able to…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Analyze real-world data to answer questions about multivariable relationships for a continuous outcome</p></li>
<li><p>Build, fit, and evaluate linear regression models</p></li>
<li><p>Assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations</p></li>
<li><p>Use R and Quarto to write reproducible reports</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate results from statistical analyses to a general audience</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These learning objectives were adapted from <a href="https://maria-tackett.netlify.app/project/02_sta210/">Maria Tackett’s Regression Analysis course</a>.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="slack">Slack</h4>
<p>We will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask me by posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack.</p>
<p><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/slack-xvk6383/shared_invite/zt-29g7biioz-XhPs~tj8xwL1GajEw9YlTg">**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**</a></p>
<p><strong>Tips on asking questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When reaching out for help for a homework problem, please include some context on what you have already tried.
<ul>
<li>For example, including a photo of your work thus far with an explanation of where you think you might be wrong is a quick way for me to look over your work and help you troubleshoot. This helps me see what parts you already understand and which you need help with. If your question involves code, please <strong>include the copied code (not a screenshot)</strong> and an attachment to your full file. This way I can see the exact line you need help with and the full code in case the problem starts earlier.</li>
<li>If you are unsure how to start a problem, look through your notes and the book for examples that you think might be similar. When reaching out, mention these examples and why you think they might be helpful, but also why you are still unsure on how to proceed.</li>
<li>If you only write something similar to “I don’t know how to do problem xxx,” then my response will be to ask you what you tried so far. Thus, it will be quicker for you to let me know this information right away.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If asking for help about a specific example that you don’t understand, please also provide some detail beyond “I don’t understand example xxx.”
<ul>
<li>Which steps of the problem do you not understand? You can refer to a line number, for example.</li>
<li>If you don’t understand the first step, do you understand the ones following it?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In general, when asking a question, please provide the homework number it is from along with the chapter and problem number. If it’s an example from the notes or book, an example number or slide number will help finding it.</li>
<li>Want more tips on asking questions? This list on <a href="https://www.weareteachers.com/8-ways-to-pose-better-questions-in-math-class/" class="uri">this site</a> will help!</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sakai">Sakai</h4>
<p>While most course materials will be delivered online through this website, assignments will be turned in through <a href="https://sakai.ohsu.edu/">Sakai</a>, OHSU’s course management system. I will include a link on this website to the Sakai assignment page.&nbsp;</p>

<section id="explain-everything" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explain-everything">Explain Everything</h4>
<p>I plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real-time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way of in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher.&nbsp;</p>

<section id="webex" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="webex">Webex</h4>
<p>Webex software will be used for virtual office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, I recommend the following best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please stay muted until you want to participate</li>
<li>During office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like “I have a question.” This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone’s questions in order.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="poll-everywhere" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="poll-everywhere">Poll Everywhere</h4>
<p>We will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.</p>

<p>PennState has a class offered to online MS students that has some overlap with our class. They have all their <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/">course notes posted on this page</a>. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.</p>
<p>Not all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course’s concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No student has the same amount of time available to dedicate to homework. This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are <strong>formative assessments</strong>, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: <strong>Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong).</strong> I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!</p>
<p>After the due date, the TAs will give you feedback (on one or more complete problems) and post the solutions.</p>

<p>I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control.

Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The class will end on March 22, 2024. <strong>All coursework is expected to be completed by then.</strong> If you have <em>extenuating circumstances</em>, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.</p></li>
<li><p>For homework, there is a due date posted, but you may turn in the assignment any time before the class ends. I will give you the check regardless of when you submit the assignment. <strong>However, if you would like feedback on the homework, you must turn it in on time OR email me asking for feedback for your late homework.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>For non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won’t necessarily grant one.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able.&nbsp;</p></li>

<p>You are expected to attend class, participate in-class polls, and complete the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, <strong>viewing the recording within 7 days</strong> is acceptable. This is meant to keep you on track within the course and prevent a pile up of material. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance.</p>

<p>Please note that this section has been motivated by <a href="https://dmice.ohsu.edu/bedricks/courses/bmi525/policies.html">Dr.&nbsp;Steven Bedrick’s Course Policies and Grading site</a> for BMI 525. (Note that this is a good example of informal attribution of someone else’s work.)</p>
<p>In this class, it is easy to use ChatGPT or other AI tools to solve your homework for you. Many problems follow a basic structure that is especially easy for ChatGPT to solve. In this class, you may use ChatGPT to help with your homework. You may even ask for direct answers. However, there are a few things I do not want you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Do not copy ChatGPT’s answer directly into your homework.</strong> Your homework is graded for full credit if you turn it in, in any state, so turning in ChatGPT’s answers is unacceptable. I rather see half-written answers that show what you’re thinking than see a correct answer from ChatGPT.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not stop once ChatGPT answered a question.</strong> If it gives an explanation, interact with it! Make sure you understand the thought process of ChatGPT. Try writing out the process to help cement it in your head. Check the answer with what we learn in class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not use ChatGPT on our quizzes!</strong> Hence, you need to really understand how to solve these problems even if you use ChatGPT on the homework.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, ChatGPT is a resource that will be available to you in a job and outside of school. Thus, we should use it as a tool in school as well! Let me know if ChatGPT helped you understand something! I would love to incorporate it into future classes!</p>

<p>You can think of this class as assembling a toolbox. When a handyperson starts working for the first time, they need to buy their tools. For their first few jobs, they might need help finding their tools, or remembering which tool is best used for what action. Eventually, they get to know their tools well, and using them appropriately becomes second nature.</p>
<p><strong>For now, ChatGPT can help us find and use our tools, but we need to work towards using them as second nature!</strong></p>

<p><u><em>Commitment to your learning and your success<br>
</em></u>I believe that everyone has the ability to be successful in this course and I have put a lot of effort into designing the course in a way that maximizes your learning to ensure your success. Please talk to me before or after class or stop by my office if there is anything you want to discuss or about which you are unclear. I want to be supportive of your learning and growth.</p>
<p><u><em>Inclusive &amp; supportive learning community</em></u><br>
I believe that learning happens best when we all learn together, as a community. This means creating a space characterized by generous listening, civility, humility, patience, and hospitality. I will attempt to promote a safe climate where we examine content from multiple cultural perspectives, and I will strive to create and maintain a classroom atmosphere in which you feel free to both listen to others and express your views and ask questions to increase your learning.</p>
<p><u><em>Openness to feedback</em></u><br>
I appreciate straightforward feedback from you regarding how well the class is meeting your needs. Let me know if material is not clear or when its relevance to the student learning outcomes for the course is not apparent. In particular, let me know if you identify bias or stereotyping in my teaching materials as I will seek to continuously improve. Please also let me know if there’s an aspect of the class you find particularly interesting, helpful, or enjoyable!</p>
<p><u><em>Responsiveness<br>
</em></u>I will monitor email as well as the discussion board daily and try respond to all messages within 24 hours Monday-Friday.</p>
<p><u><em>Clear guidelines and prompt feedback on assignments</em></u><br>
I will provide clear instructions for all assignments, and a grading rubric when applicable. I will provide detailed feedback on your submissions and will update grades promptly in Sakai.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="student-expectations-and-resources">Student Expectations and Resources</h3>
<p><u><em>Attend class</em></u><strong><br>
</strong>You are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings synchronously or watch the recording within 7 days. Attendance is taken through exit tickets. If you have issues accessing the poll on a specific day, please let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><em>Participate<strong><br>
</strong></em></u>I encourage you to participate actively in class and online discussions. I will expect all students, and all instructors, to be respectful of each other’s contributions, whether I agree with them or not. Professional interactions are expected.</p>
<p><u><em>Build rapport</em></u><br>
If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let me know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional. Make sure that you are proactive in informing me when difficulties arise during the quarter so that I can help you find a solution.</p>
<p><u><em>Complete assignments</em></u><br>
All assignments for this course will be submitted electronically through Sakai unless otherwise instructed.&nbsp; I encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand that sometimes circumstances arise that are beyond our control. If you need an extension, please contact me in congruence with the Late Policy.</p>
<p><u><em>Seek help if you need it</em></u><strong><br>
</strong>I believe it is important to support the physical and emotional well‐being of my students. If you are experiencing physical or mental health issues, I encourage you to use the resources on campus such as those listed below. If you have a health issue that is affecting your performance or participation in the course, and/or if you need help connecting with these resources, please contact me.</p>

<p><u><em>Inform your instructor of any accommodations needed</em></u><br>
You should speak with or email me before or during the first week of classes regarding any special needs. Students seeking academic accommodations should register with the appropriate service under the School policies below.</p>
<p>Some religious holidays may occur on regularly scheduled class days. Because available class hours are so limited in number, we will have to hold class on all such days. Class video recordings will be available and you are encouraged to engage with the material outside of the regular class time. You are also encouraged to come to office hours with questions from the session.</p>
<p><u><em>Commit to integrity</em></u><strong><br>
</strong>As a student in this course (and at PSU or OHSU) you are expected to maintain high degrees of professionalism, commitment to active learning and participation in this class and also integrity in your behavior in and out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Cheating and other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated in this course and will be dealt with firmly. Student academic misconduct refers to behavior that includes plagiarism, cheating on assignments, fabrication of data, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), or aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. Preparation of exams, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each student’s own individual effort. When used, resource materials should be cited in conventional reference format.</p>

<p><strong>Sakai/Slack announcements<br>
</strong>For important/urgent matters, I will communicate with you using announcements via Sakai that will be delivered to your OHSU Email account as well as displayed in the Sakai course site Announcements section. I will copy these announcements in Slack if they do not involve changes to the schedule. Unfortunately, there are certain announcements that OHSU requires I initiate behind the firewall.</p>
<p><strong>General course questions<br>
</strong>It is normal to have many questions about things that relate to the course, such as clarification about assignments, course materials, or assessments. Please post these on our Slack Workspace. Please use the channels that I created for questions. You are encouraged to give answers and help each other. I will monitor these threads, so I will endorse or correct responses as needed. Please give me 24 hours to respond to questions within Monday-Friday. Work-life balance is important for me as well, so I will try to respond as quickly as I can within my healthy limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E-mail</strong><br>
E-mail should be used only for messages that are private in nature. Please send private messages to my OHSU email address (wakim@ohsu.edu). <strong>Messages sent through Sakai Inbox will not be answered.</strong> Do not send messages asking general information about the class; please post those on Slack instead.</p>
