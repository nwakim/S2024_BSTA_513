They will make sure each section is complete and will follow the rubric below. I have instructed them that completion and clear effort is all that is needed to receive 100%. Nicky will go through the labs to give you feedback.\n\n#### Rubric\n\n|             | 4 points                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 3 points                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2 points                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1 point                                                                                                                                                                                  | 0 points                                                                                                               |\n|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Formatting  | Lab submitted on Sakai with `.html` file.

Make sure the class that `R` recognizes is the class that you expect the variable to be. For example, if I am using age, but the class is character, I will need to convert age to a numeric variable.\n\n### Consider potential confounders and effect modifiers\n\nFor each variable, fill out this table:\n\n| Variable name | Confounder, Effect modifier, or nothing? | Reasoning (1-2 sentences) |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n|               |                                          |                           |\n\n### Peek at your outcome\n\nThis serves as a check to make sure we are all looking at the correct outcome: IAT score.\n\n::: callout-important\n##### Task\n\nPlease plot a histogram of the IAT scores. What do you notice about the outcome?\n:::\n\n### Univariate exploratory data analysis\n\n::: callout-important\n##### Task\n\nUsing `ggplot` or tables, visualize your variables. Get a sense of each variable's distribution. Do you notice anything out of the ordinary?\n:::\n\n### Bivariate exploratory data analysis\n\n::: callout-important\n##### Task\n\nTake a look at the scatterplot, violin, or box plot of IAT score and your variable of interest. Use R and `ggplot` to make this plot. If your variable of interest is categorical, then make sure to use a violin or boxplot.\n:::\n\n### Multivariate\n\n### Fit simple logistic regression\n",
