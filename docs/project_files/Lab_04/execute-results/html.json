Then you can load it here!\n\n### Restate your research question\n\n::: callout-important\n##### Task\n\nPlease restate your research question below using the provided format. It's repetitive, but it helps me contextualize my feedback as I look through your lab.\n:::\n\n### Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\n1.  Run a simple linear regression model for each covariate against the IAT score (outcome).\n2.  Display results from the test if each covariate explains enough variation of the outcome. This may be from three options in the instructions: `summary()/anova()` only, `lapply()`, or `sapply()`\n\nInterpretation of the results will be in the next step.\n:::\n\n### Step 2: Preliminary variable selection\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\n1.    Decide which covariates will be included in the initial model and list them. \n2.    Run the initial model and display the regression table.\n\nNo need to write out the model, but you may *in addition* to the list. \n:::\n\n### Step 3: Assess change in coefficient\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\nRemove variables from the initial model based on your common sense, change in coefficient, and/or p-values of the F-tests.\n\n**You do NOT need to show all your work here.** You just need to include: \n\n1.    A brief explanation of what variables were dropped and why (a sentence per variable), and\n2.    An example of your process with one variable is enough (including code that you ran)\n:::\n\n### Step 4: Assess scale for continuous variables\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\nNo tasks here! If you want to try out what I did above, you can!\n:::\n\n### Step 5: Check for interactions\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\nUsing your discussion in Lab 3 and the results from the F-test on interactions:\n\n1.    Create a list of the interactions that you will include in your model.\n2.    Run the preliminary final model that includes the main effects and interactions.\n:::\n\n### Step 6: Assess model fit\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\n**Optional:** Create a table that displays some fo the model fit statistics to compare preliminary final models.\n:::\n\n### Create a forest plot of your coefficient estimates\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\nCreate a forest plot to visualize the coefficient estimates. \n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
