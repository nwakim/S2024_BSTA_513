**Brief professor statement:** As a professor, my main goal is to instill a growth mindset into my students. Growth mindset means we are NOT stuck in our abilities or knowledge, and that we all can and will grow! This course aims to be as transparent as possible. I want you to understand my motivation for assessments, questions, and lessons. I also want those assessments to be clear, so please ask for clarification whenever needed.
