**Brief professor statement:** As a professor, my main goal is to
instill a growth mindset into my students. Growth mindset means we are
NOT stuck in our abilities or knowledge, and that we all can and will
grow! This course aims to be as transparent as possible. I want you to
understand my motivation for assessments, questions, and lessons. I also
want those assessments to be clear, so please ask for clarification
whenever needed.

**Introduction from Becky:**

> Hello fellow MPH classmates! My name is Becky Lanford. I’m looking
> forward to helping support you in your coursework this quarter. A
> little about my background: I am currently in my final year in the MPH
> Epidemiology track and have completed most of my coursework including
> the biostatistics and epidemiology series (mostly working in R). I
> enrolled at the SPH as someone re-entering the workforce and quite new
> to statistical programming. Though I had previously completed a
> graduate degree (as a Physician Assistant/Associate), re-acclimating
> to graduate work and learning programming skills made for a steep
> learning curve my first academic year. I credit the collaborative
> learning environment at SPH - support of TA's and classmates and
> availability of instructors - for helping me be successful. I hope I
> can help answer course-content questions, problem solve with you and
> find answers if I don’t have them myself. I know there are many
> challenges to being a graduate student and I am excited to help our
> public health student community grow stronger and more knowledgeable
> together.
