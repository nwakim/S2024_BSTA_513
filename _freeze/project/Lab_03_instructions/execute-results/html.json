I am working on guided instructions on incorporating the *optional* missing data section of the Lab.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Directions\n\n[You can download the `.qmd` file for this lab here.](https://github.com/nwakim/S2024_BSTA_513/blob/main/project/LastName_FirstInit_Lab_03.qmd)\n\nThe above link will take you to your **editing** file. **Please do not remove anything from this editing file!!** You will only add your code and work to this file.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this lab is to fit a multiple logistic regression model and practice how we would interpret our results for this study.\n\n### Grading\n\n**This lab is graded out of 12 points.** The TAs will go through and grade your lab. They will make sure each section is complete and will follow the rubric below. I have instructed them that completion and clear effort is all that is needed to receive 100%. Nicky will go through the labs to give you feedback.\n\n#### Rubric\n\n|             | 4 points                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 3 points                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2 points                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1 point                                                                                                                                                                                  | 0 points                                                                                                               |\n|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Formatting  | Lab submitted on Sakai with `.html` file.

You can change the wording if you'd like, but please make sure it is still clear. Itâ€™s repetitive, but it helps me contextualize my feedback as I look through your lab.\n:::\n\nIn this study, we will investigate the association between food insecurity and ________. \n\n### Fit a multiple logistic regression model\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Task\n\nFit a main effects model with 5 of your covariates. This will not necessarily be your final model, but we can construct interpretations and code that will be useful in your final model. \n:::\n\n### Present the odds ratio in a table\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Task\n\nUse the `tbl_regression()` function to make a table of the odds ratios from your fitted model.\n:::\n\n### Present the odds ratio in a forest plot\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Task\n\nUse the code from Lesson 10 to make a forest plot of the odds ratio from your fitted model. \n:::\n\n### Interpret the odds ratio for your main covariate\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Task\n\nInterpret the odds ratio(s) for the covariate from your research question. Make sure to include the 95% confidence intervals and what other variables you adjusted for. \n:::\n",
