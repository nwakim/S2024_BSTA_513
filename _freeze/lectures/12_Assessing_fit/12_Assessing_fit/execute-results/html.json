As seen in @fig-plots-1, the odds ratio of a new fracture when comparing prior fracture status decreases with age, indicating that the effect of prior fractures on new fractures decreases as individuals get older. In @fig-plots-2, it is evident that for both prior fracture statuses, the predict probability of a new fracture increases as age increases. However, the predicted probability of new fracture for those without a prior fracture increases at a higher rate than that of individuals with a prior fracture. Thus, the predicted probabilities of a new fracture converge at age \\[insert age here\\].\n:::\n\n::: column\n\n::: {#fig-plots .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Odds ratio of fracture outcome comparing prior fracture to no prior fracture](12_Assessing_fit_files/figure-revealjs/fig-plots-1.png){#fig-plots-1 width=960}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Predicted probability of fracture](12_Assessing_fit_files/figure-revealjs/fig-plots-2.png){#fig-plots-2 width=960}\n:::\n\nPlots of odds ratio and predicted probability from fitted interaction model\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Overview (1/2)\n\n-   Once a potential final model has been determined, we need to assess the fit of the model\n\n \n\n-   Variable selection is no longer our focus at this stage\n\n    -   We want to find answer to whether the model fits the data adequately\n\n \n\n-   Assessing the Goodness of Fit or Assessing model fit\n\n    -   Assess how well our fitted logistic regression model predicts/estimates the observed outcomes\n\n    -   Comparison: fitted/estimated outcome vs. observed outcome\n\n## Some good measurements for our final model(s)\n\n-   Pearson residual statistic\n\n \n\n-   Hosmer-Lemeshaw goodness-of-fit statistic\n\n \n\n-   AUC-ROC (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic)\n\n \n\n-   AIC/BIC\n\n \n\n## Overview (2/2)\n\n-   To assess the fit of the model, it is good to have a mixture of measurements\n\n \n\n-   We want to **measure the absolute fit**: not comparing to any models, but determining if the model fits the data well\n\n    -   Pearson residual statistic\n    -   Hosmer-Lemeshaw goodness-of-fit statistic\n    -   AUC-ROC (kind of, often do not use a hypothesis test but you can!)\n\n \n\n-   We want **comparable measures of fit**: if we have candidate models that are not nested\n\n    -   AUC-ROC\n    -   AIC/BIC\n\n## Poll Everywhere Question 1\n\n## Components to Assess Model Fit\n\n-   The model fits the data well if\n\n    -   Summary measures of the distance between the predicted/estimated/fitted and observed Y are small\n\n        -   Today's lecture!!\n\n    -   The contribution of each pair (predicted and observed) to these summary measures is unsystematic and is small relative to the error structure of the model\n\n        -   Model Diagnostics that will be covered in another lecture!\n\n \n\n-   Need both components\n\n    -   It is possible to see a “good” summary measure of the distance between predicted and observed Y with some substantial deviation from fit for a few subjects\n\n## Summary Measures of Goodness of Fit\n\n-   Aka overall measure of fit\n\n \n\n-   What do we need to calculate them?\n\n    -   Need to define what the fitted outcome is\n\n    -   Need to calculate how close the fitted outcome is to the observed outcome\n\n    -   Summarize across all observations (or individuals’ data)\n\n \n\n-   Two tests of goodness-of-fit\n\n    -   Pearson residual statistic\n    -   Hosmer-Lemeshaw goodness-of-fit statistic\n\n## Comparing *fitted outcome* to observed outcome\n\n-   In logistic regression model, we estimate $\\pi(\\mathbf{X}) = P(Y=1|\\mathbf{X})$\n\n    -   Predicted value, $\\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X})$, is between 0 and 1 for each subject\n\n-   However, we always observe $Y=1$ or $Y=0$\n\n    -   Not an observed $\\pi(\\mathbf{X})$\n\n \n\n-   We can deterimine the fitted outcome by sampling Y's from a Bernoulli distribution with the fitted probability\n\n    -   $\\widehat{Y} \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X}))$\n\n-   If there are groups of individuals that share the *same covariate observations*, then we can use the same $\\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X})$\n\n    -   $\\sum_j \\widehat{Y} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(\\sum_j, \\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X}))$\n\n \n\n-   Instead of comparing the expected vs. observed at individual level, we can compare them at “group” level\n\n## Number of Covariate Patterns\n\n-   When the logistic regression model contains only categorical covariates, we can think of the number of covariate patterns\n\n-   **For example:** model contains two binary covariates (history of fracture and smoking status), there will be 4 unique combination of these factors\n\n    -   This model has 4 covariate patterns\n    -   Subjects can be divided into 4 groups based on the covariates’ values\n\n-   We can then compute the predicted number of individuals with Y=1 in each group, and compare that with the actual observed number of individuals with Y=1 in that group\n\n    -   We don't need to sample this\n    -   We use the expected value (mean) of the Binomial to determine the $\\widehat{Y}$ for each covariate pattern\n    -   For covariate pattern $j$ with $m_j$ observations: $$\\widehat{Y}_j = m_j \\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X_j}) = m_j{\\hat{\\pi}}_j$$\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\n::: lob\n1.

Write a [**conclusion**]{style=\"color:#70AD47\"} to the hypothesis test\n\n    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?\n    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem\n\n## Not going to bother going through an example\n\n-   We can calculate this by hand and test against a chi-squared distribution\n\n \n\n-   No set R code to do this\n\n \n\n-   I do not see this as the main way to determine goodness of fit... for a binary outcome!\n\n    -   Often because of the bigger issues with it...\n\n## Issues with Pearson Residuals\n\n-   Assume current model has p covariates…\n\n    -   then $X^2$ (Pearson residual) follows a chi-squared distribution\n\n        -   under the null hypothesis based on large sample theory\n\n    -   **Only appropriate if the number of covariate patterns is less than the number of observations**\n\n \n\n-   When the logistic regression model contains **one or more continuous covariates**, it is likely that the **number of covariate patterns equals to the sample size n**\n\n \n\n-   We should **not use Pearson Residuals** to evaluate goodness-of-fit test when the fitted **model contains one or more continuous variables**\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\n1.

Compute estimated probability $\\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X}))$ for all n subjects ($n=1, 2, ..., n$)\n    2.  Order $\\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X}))$ from largest to smallest values\n    3.  Divide ordered values into g percentile grouping (usually $g = 10$ based on H-L’s suggestion)\n    4.  Form table of observed and expected counts\n    5.  Calculate HL test statistic from table\n    6.  Compare HL test statistic to chi-squared distribution ($\\chi^2_{g-2}$)\n\n## Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic\n\n-   The test statistic of Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test is denoted by $\\widehat{C}$, which is obtained by calculating the Pearson chi-squared statistic from the $g \\times 2$ table of observed and estimated expected frequencies $$\\hat{C}=\\sum_{k=1}^{g}\\frac{\\left(o_k-n_k^\\prime{\\bar{\\pi}}_k\\right)^2}{n_k^\\prime{\\bar{\\pi}}_k(1-{\\bar{\\pi}}_k)}$$\n\n    -   where $n'_k$ is the total number of subjects in the $k$th group\n\n-   Let $c_k$ be the number of covariate patterns in the $k$th decile: $$o_k=\\sum_{j=1}^{c_k}y_j$$ and $${\\bar{\\pi}}_k=\\sum_{j=1}^{c_k}\\frac{m_j{\\hat{\\pi}}_j}{n_k^\\prime}$$\n\n## Hosmer-Lemeshow test procedure\n\n1.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style=\"color:#70AD47\"} $\\alpha$\n\n2.  Specify the [**null**]{style=\"color:#70AD47\"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style=\"color:#70AD47\"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style=\"color:#70AD47\"}: same for all data\n\n    -   $H_0$: model fits well\n    -   $H_1$: model does not fits well\n\n3.

Write a [**conclusion**]{style=\"color:#70AD47\"} to the hypothesis test\n\n    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?\n    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem\n\n## GLOW Study: Hosmer-Lemeshow test\n\n-   Okay, so let's look at the interaction model from last class $$\\text{logit}\\left(\\pi(\\mathbf{X})\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\cdot I(\\text{PF}) +\\beta_2\\cdot Age + \\beta_3 \\cdot I(\\text{PF}) \\cdot Age$$\n\n-   We need to fit the model and use a new command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglow_m3 = glm(fracture ~ priorfrac + age_c + priorfrac*age_c, \n              data = glow, family = binomial)\nlibrary(ResourceSelection)\nobs_vals = as.numeric(glow$fracture) -1\nfit_vals = fitted(glow_m3)\nhoslem.test(obs_vals, fit_vals, g = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tHosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit (GOF) test\n\ndata:  obs_vals, fit_vals\nX-squared = 6.778, df = 8, p-value = 0.5608\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote to Nicky: do NOT make conclusion yet! In the poll everywhere!\n\n## Poll Everywhere question 3\n\n## GLOW Study: Hosmer-Lemeshow test\n\n-   Conclusion: The p-value is 0.5608, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the model fits the data well. Thus, the preliminary final model for the GLOW dataset fits the data well\n\n \n\n-   Don’t forget that we still need to check individual observations (Model Diagnostics!)\n\n \n\n-   R may give results for the HL test even if it is not appropriate to use it!\n\n    -   If number of covariate patterns ≤ 6, do not use HL test\n\n## Big Data Issue in Goodness-of-fit Test\n\n-   When the sample size is really big (\\> 1000), it is much more likely to find the H-L reject the model fit (even when the expected vs. observed in each decile categories looks pretty similar)\n\n \n\n-   This is due to “too much” power in hypothesis testing.\n\n    -   Paul et al. (2012) for samples sizes from 1000 to 25,000, the number of groups g should be equal to $$g=\\max{\\left(10,\\min{\\left\\{\\frac{n_1}{2},\\ \\frac{n-n_1}{2},\\ 2+8\\left(\\frac{n}{1000}\\right)^2\\right\\}}\\right)}$$\n\n \n\n-   For example, if one has a sample with $n=10, 000$ (sample size) and $n_1=1,000$ (number of events) then $g=500$ groups are suggested\n\n-   For n \\> 25000, other methods, such as partitioning data into a developmental data set (with smaller n) and a validation set\n\n## Final Notes on Goodness-of-fit Test\n\n-   They should not be used for variable selection\n\n    -   The likelihood ratio tests for significance of coefficients are much more powerful and appropriate (when nested)\n\n \n\n-   They are not for model comparison\n\n    -   One should **not** use the p-value from goodness of fit tests of different models to decide which model is better than the other\n\n    -   Something like AUC-ROC, AIC, or BIC can be used\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\n1.

Apply AIC and BIC as a summary measure to make additional comparisons between potential models\n:::\n\n\n## AIC and BIC\n\n-   Two widely used non-hypothesis testing based measurements that helps select a good model\n\n    -   Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)\n    -   Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\n\n \n\n-   Unlike likelihood ratio test which is only suitable for nested model, **AIC and BIC are suitable for both nested and non-nested model**\n\n \n\n-   There is no hypothesis/conclusion testing for the comparison between two models\n\n    -   So not the best for selecting covariates to include in model\n    -   **BUT helpful if you have a few preliminary final models that you want to compare**\n\n## Poll Everywhere Question 5\n\n## AIC and BIC\n\n-   Both AIC and BIC penalize a model for having many parameters\n\n \n\n| Measure of fit                       | Equation                                                | R code            |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| Akaike information criterion (AIC)   | $AIC = -2 \\cdot \\text{log-likelihood} + 2q$             | `AIC(model_name)` |\n| Bayesian information criterion (BIC) | $AIC = -2 \\cdot \\text{log-likelihood} + q\\text{log}(n)$ | `BIC(model_name)` |\n\n \n\n-   Where q is the number of parameters in the model and n is the sample size\n\n-   Both AIC and BIC can only be used to compare models fitting the same data set\n\n-   In comparing two models, the model with smaller AIC and/or BIC is preferred\n\n    -   When the difference in AIC between two models exceeds 3, the difference is viewed as “meaningful”\n\n## AIC and BIC in R\n\n-   After fitting the logistic regression model, can calculate AIC and BIC\n-   Let's look at the AIC and BIC of our interaction model:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAIC(glow_m3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 531.2716\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBIC(glow_m3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 548.13\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Summary (1/2)\n\n| Measure of fit       | Hypothesis tested?     | Equation                                                                                                            | R code                     |\n|----------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| Pearson residual     | Yes                    | $X^2=\\sum_{j=1}^{J}{r\\left(Y_j,{\\hat{\\pi}}_j\\right)^2}$                                                             | Not given                  |\n| Hosmer-Lemeshow test | Yes                    | $\\hat{C}=\\sum_{k=1}^{g}\\frac{\\left(o_k-n_k^\\prime{\\bar{\\pi}}_k\\right)^2}{n_k^\\prime{\\bar{\\pi}}_k(1-{\\bar{\\pi}}_k)}$ | `hoslem.test()`            |\n| AUC-ROC              | Kinda                  | Not given                                                                                                           | `auc(observed, predicted)` |\n| AIC                  | Only to compare models | $AIC = -2 \\cdot \\text{log-likelihood} + 2q$                                                                         | `AIC(model_name)`          |\n| BIC                  | Only to compare models | $AIC = -2 \\cdot \\text{log-likelihood} + q\\text{log}(n)$                                                             | `BIC(model_name)`          |\n\nSpecial notes:\n\n-   Use Hosmer-Lemshow test over Pearson residual unless number of covariate patterns is less than 6\n\n-   Cannot use Pearson residual when there is a continuous variable in the model\n\n## Summary (2/2)\n\n-   For our interaction model: $$\\begin{aligned} \\text{logit}\\left(\\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X})\\right) & = \\widehat\\beta_0 &+ &\\widehat\\beta_1\\cdot I(\\text{PF}) & + &\\widehat\\beta_2\\cdot Age& + &\\widehat\\beta_3 \\cdot I(\\text{PF}) \\cdot Age \\\\  \n    \\text{logit}\\left(\\widehat\\pi(\\mathbf{X})\\right) & = -1.376 &+ &1.002\\cdot I(\\text{PF})& + &0.063\\cdot Age& -&0.057 \\cdot I(\\text{PF}) \\cdot Age\n    \\end{aligned}$$\n    \n-   We can examine the overall model fit using:\n\n    -   Not comparing to any other models:\n\n        -   Pearson residual: Not appropriate for this model\n        -   Hosmer-Lemeshow: $\\hat{C}=6.778$, p-value = 0.56\n        -   AUC-ROC: 0.6819\n\n    -   Can be used to compare to other models:\n\n        -   AUC-ROC: 0.6819\n        -   AIC: 531.27\n        -   BIC: 548.13\n\n\n",
