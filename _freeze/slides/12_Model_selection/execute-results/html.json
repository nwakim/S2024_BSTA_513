Explain the general process or idea behind different model selection techniques\n3.  Recognize common model fit statistics and understand what they measure\n\n## Why can't I just throw in all the variables into my model?\n\n-   First, let's think about the number of observations in our dataset\n\n-   For example: In the Gapminder dataset, I can use an indicator for each country\n\n    -   Remember that each country is an observation\n\n    -   So we have a perfectly fit model - a covariate for each observation\n\n    -   But we cannot generalize this to any other countries\n\n    -   And we haven't identified any meaningful relationships between life expectancy and other measured characteristics\n\n-   More covariates in the model is not always better\n\n    -   Overfitting the data limits our generalizability and prevents us from answering research questions\n\n## Model Complexity vs. Parsimony\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nSuppose we have $p = 30$ covariates (in the true model) and n = 50 observations. We could consider the following two alternatives:\n\n1.  We could fit a model using all of the covariates.\n    -   In this case, $\\widehat\\beta$ is unbiased for $\\beta$ (in a linear model fit using OLS). But $\\widehat\\beta$ has very high variance.\n2.  We could fit a model using only the five strongest covariates.\n    -   In this case, $\\widehat\\beta$ will be biased for $\\beta$, but it will have lower variance (compared to the estimate including all covariates)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n[![Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html](13_Model_selection/bullseye.png){fig-align=\"center\"}](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Bias-variance trade off\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Recall mean square error is a function of SSE (sum of squared residuals)\n\n    $$\n    MSE = \\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\big(Y_i - \\widehat{Y}_i \\big)^2\n    $$\n\n-   MSE can also be written as a function of the bias and variance\n\n    $$\n    MSE = \\text{bias}\\big(\\widehat\\beta\\big)^2 + \\text{variance}\\big(\\widehat\\beta\\big)\n    $$\n\n-   For the same data:\n\n    -   More covariates in model: less bias, more variance\n\n    -   Less covariates in model: more bias, less variance\n\n-   Out goal: find a model with just the right amount of covariates to balance bias and vairance\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n[![Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html](13_Model_selection/biasvariance_tradeoff.png){width=\"1000\"}](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Model Selection basics (slide adjusted from Jodi Lapidus)\n\n-   \"Because models always fall far short of the complex reality under study, there are no best or optimal strategies for modeling.\"\n\n    -   From: [Statistical Foundations for Model-Based Adjustments](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031914-122559)\n\n-   Not all statistical texts provide practical advice on model development\n\n    -   A lot of resources include methods/code to compare models, but does not include much advice re: selecting which model to ultimately use.\n    -   Other texts are sparse on details or incorporate simplistic approaches\n\n-   Model development strategy should **align with research goals**\n\n    -   Prediction vs. Estimating Association\n    -   Strategy may depend on study design and data set size\n\n## The goals of association vs. prediction\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n::: definition\n::: def-title\nAssociation / Explanatory / One variable's effect\n:::\n\n::: def-cont\n-   **Goal:** Understand one variable's (or a group of variable's) effect on the response after adjusting for other factors\n\n-   Mainly interpret the coefficient of the variable that is the focus of the study\n\n    -   Interpreting the coefficients of the other variables is not important, but can help bring context\n\n-   Any variables not selected for the final model have still been adjusted for, since they had a chance to be in the model\n\n-   Example: How is body mass of a penguin associated with flipper length?\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: column\n::: proposition\n::: prop-title\nPrediction\n:::\n\n::: prop-cont\n-   **Goal:** to calculate the most precise prediction of the response variable\n\n-   Interpreting coefficients is not important\n\n-   Choose only the variables that are strong predictors of the response variable\n\n    -   Excluding irrelevant variables can help reduce widths of the prediction intervals\n\n-   Example: What is the flipper length of a penguin with body mass of 3000 g (and all its other characteristics)?\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Model building for association vs. prediction\n\n[More information on the two analysis goals:](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.pmrj.2014.08.941)\n\n![](13_Model_selection/explanatory_v_prediction.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n[If you ever get the chance, check out Dr. Kristin Sainani's series on Statistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/authored-by/Sainani/Kristin+L.?startPage=&SeriesKey=19341563)\n\n## Poll Everywhere Question 1\n\n## Model selection strategies for *continuous* outcomes\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n::: definition\n::: def-title\nAssociation / Explanatory / One variable's effect\n:::\n\n::: def-cont\n-   Selection of potential models is tied more with the research context with some incorporation of prediction scores\n\n-   Pre-specification of multivariable model\n\n-   Purposeful model selection\n\n    -

Understand the motivation for model selection, including bias-variance trade off and alignment of research goals (association vs. prediction)\n\n::: lob\n2.  Explain the general process or idea behind different model selection techniques\n:::\n\n3.  Recognize common model fit statistics and understand what they measure\n\n## Pre-specification of multivariable model (slide adjusted from Jodi Lapidus)\n\n-   In a clinical trial, we often have to write and finalize a statistical analysis plan (SAP) before the trial starts\n\n-   If we wish to compare treatment effects adjusted for covariates, all covariates typically specified in advance\n\n    -   Example: Comparing effectiveness of 3-drug vs. 2-drug regimen for delaying AIDS onset or death. Covariates such as severity of HIV infection at baseline would have been specified in advance.\n\n    -   Variables such as study site, as well as any randomization stratification variables are common covariates.\n\n-   In these cases, only a limited number of multivariable models are fit and reported\n\n    -   Do not perform all the model building steps outlined in Hosmer and Lemeshow texts\n\n## Purposeful model selection (slide adjusted from Jodi Lapidus)\n\n-   Can use this type of model selection for any type of regression\n\n-   Careful, well-thought out variable selection process\n\n    -   Considers both confounding and interaction, as well as checking model assumptions, fit, etc.\n\n-   Often a reasonable strategy, especially in epidemiology and more exploratory clinical studies\n\n    -   However, not always appropriate!\n    -   E.g. clinical trials with model specified in advance. (pre-specified model)\n\n \n\n-   **This is the selection process that we will focus on in this class!**\n\n## Change in estimate (CIE) approach (slide adjusted from Jodi Lapidus)\n\n-   CIE strategies select covariates on the basis of how much their control changes exposure effect estimates\n\n    -   Observed change is presumed to measure confounding by the covariate.\n\n-   What estimate?\n\n    -   H/L text suggest using coefficients from the model\n    -   We typically use the coefficient estimate from the explanatory variable that we are most interested in\n\n-   What magnitude change is ”important”?\n\n    -   H/L text suggest 10%\n\n-   One must choose an effect measure to judge change importance, where \"importance\" needs to be evaluated along a contextually meaningful scale\n\n-   Accurate assessment of confounding may require examining changes from removing entire sets of covariates\n\n    -   Add in or eliminate candidate confounders one at time?\n    -   Add in or eliminate candidate confounders in sets?\n\n## Stepwise selection (slide adjusted from Adrianna Westbrook)\n\n-   This is an incredibly common approach that statisticians use, often because it is an older and more recognized method\n\n    -   BUT IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE WORST MODEL SELECTION STRATEGIES!!\n\n-   Major disadvantages to stepwise selection:\n\n    -   Prone to overfitting\n    -   Biased estimates\n    -   Cements the wrong idea that we are looking for our \"most significant\" covariates\n\n-   Predictors/covariates are added or removed one at time if they are below a certain threshold (usually p-value below 0.10 to 0.20)\n\n## Stepwise selection: two common approaches\n\n-   I will introduce two of the approaches so that you understand the general process if a collaborator ever mentions stepwise selection\n\n-   Forward selection:\n\n    -   For $p$ cvariates potential covariates, run all simple linear regressions:\n\n        -   $Y= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\epsilon$ through $Y= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{p} + \\epsilon$\n        -   Include the $X_i$ with the lowest p-value (assuming it is below the threshold)\n\n    -   Now run $Y= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\beta_2 X_1 + \\epsilon$ through $Y= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\beta_2 X_{p} + \\epsilon$ and enter the next $X_j$ with the lowest p-value\n\n    -   Continue process until no more predictors come back with a p-value below the threshold\n\n-   Backward selection:\n\n    -   Start with a full model ($Y= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + ... + \\beta_p X_p + \\epsilon$) and remove predictor with the highest p-value (assuming it is above the threshold)\n    -   Repeatedly remove the variable with the highest p-value until all remaining variables meet the stopping criteria (are below the threshold)\n\n## Best subset (slide adjusted from Adrianna Westbrook)\n\n-   I don't see this approach very often\n\n-   Quite literally making subsets of the data and using the \"best\" one\n\n-   General steps:\n\n    -   Run every possible model fitting 1 to all possible $p$ predictors/covariates\n    -   You can limit number of potential predictors\n    -   $2^p$ = total number of models where $p$ = number of predictors\n    -   You will get the best fitting model within each category (i.e., 1 predictor model, 2 predictor model,..., $p$ predictor model)\n    -   Then have to find the best fitting model between the best models from each category\n\n-   Major disadvantages to best subset:\n\n    -   Does not account for interactions\n    -   Needs to run a lot of models (takes A LOT of time)\n\n## Regularization techniques\n\n-   Regularization techniques (LASSO, ridge, elastic net) adds a penalization that shrinks (or regularizes) coefficients down to reduce overfitting\n\n|              |                                                           |                                                              |                                                                                       |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|              | LASSO (Least About Shrinkage and Selection Operator)      | Ridge                                                        | Elastic Net                                                                           |\n| Penalization | L-1 Norm, uses absolute value                             | L-2 Norm, uses squared value                                 | Best of both worlds, L-1 and L-2 used                                                 |\n| Pro's        | Reduces overfitting, will shrink coefficient to zero      | Reduces overfitting, handles collinearity, can handle k\\>n   | Reduces overfitting, handles collinearity, handles k\\>n, shrinks coefficients to zero |\n| Con's        | Cannot handle k\\>n, doesn’t handle multicollinearity well | Does not shrink coefficients to zero, difficult to interpret | More difficult for R to do than the other two (but not really that bad)               |\n\n## Poll Everywhere Question 2\n\n# Learning Objectives\n\n1.

Explain the general process or idea behind different model selection techniques\n\n::: lob\n3.  Recognize common model fit statistics and understand what they measure\n:::\n\n## Introduction to model fit statistics\n\n-   So far we have compared models using the F-test\n\n-   The F-test is a great way to compare models that are **nested**\n\n    -   Basically, this means that the \"full\" model contains all the covariates that the \"reduced\" model contains\n    -   The full model will have additional covariates, but the covariates in the reduced is a subset of the covariates in the full\n\n-   What if we want to compare models that are not nested?\n\n    -   There is a special group of fit statistics that can help us compare models\n\n    -   Note: these are sometimes used in the model building process (within one strategy)\n\n        -   Helpful if we want to compare selected models across strategies\n\n        -   Helpful if we have a few \"final\" models with different covariates that we want to compare\n\n## Common model fit statistics\n\n-   The following model fit statistics combine information about the SSE, the number of parameters in the model, and the sample size\n\n-   For these fit statistics, smaller values indicate better model fit!\n\n| Fit statistic                        | Equation                                                                              | R code                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--|\n| R-squared / Adjusted R-squared       | $Adj.
