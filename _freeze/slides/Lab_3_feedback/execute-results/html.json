I know there was a lot of plotting, but you made some great plots!\n\n-   I also appreciate your thoughtful approaches to the relationships between variables\n\n-   Just a reminder: when visualizing, making tables, displaying information from the data: always keep in the back of your mind:\n\n    -   What can a reader get from this if they have never seen the data?\n\n    -   Is it easy for the reader to understand the plot?\n\n    -   Does everything in the plot have a purpose?\n\n    -   Is the main thing I'm trying to communicate also the thing that stands out?\n\n## A few catches\n\n-   I said glimpse, but that was a bad choice of words\n\n    -   `head()` might be better to show each row with their observations and variables\n\n-   When we were looking into observations that might be suspicious...\n\n    -   We should look at the intersection of multiple suspicious observations\n\n    -   A few combinations that people came up with that I thought were good ideas:\n\n        -   Someone who chose that they felt extremely similar to fat and thin people\n\n        -   Someone who reported they were 11-14 years old with education above high school (or other age/education combos)\n\n-   If the variable is an explanatory variable and originally categorical, it's good to *keep it categorical*\n\n    -   Lots of `lm()` functions with variable treated as continuous\n\n## Multi-selection variables 1\n\n-   Splitting gender identities is NOT mutually exclusive\n\n    -   Can identify as all genders!\n\n-   If you are trying pinpoint one group and make it mutually exclusive, we need to take extra steps\n\n-   Someone wanted to identify three groups:\n\n    -   Identifies as trans man, trans woman, genderqueer/non-conforming, and/or other\n    -   Identifies as man only\n    -   Identifies as woman only\n\n-   Point on data equity:\n\n    -   Always write out all identities within a grouped category\n\n    -   I did not call the group something like non-normative genders, instead I said \"Identifies as trans man, trans woman, genderqueer/non-conforming, and/or other\"\n\n    -   Your coding names in `R` can be different, but when you write it out, make sure you define the group\n\n        -   I would maybe call the first group \"Trans and non-binary genders\" with an exact make up of the group.\n\n## Multi-selection variables 2 {.smaller}\n\n-   Create indicators for each identity: don't any lose information on the individual\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niat_new = iat_old %>%\n  mutate(ind_m = grepl(1, genderIdentity), \n         ind_f = grepl(2, genderIdentity),\n         ind_tmm = grepl(3, genderIdentity),\n         ind_twf = grepl(4, genderIdentity),\n         ind_gqnc = grepl(5, genderIdentity),\n         ind_other = grepl(6, genderIdentity))\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Create mutually exclusive groups: lose some information on the individual\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niat_new = iat_old %>% # iat_old should not have any NA's in genderIdentity\n  mutate(genderID = case_match(genderIdentity,\n                               \"[1]\" ~ \"Male/Man only\",\n                               \"[2]\" ~ \"Female/Woman only\",\n                               .default = \"Trans male/man, trans female/woman, \n                               genderqueer/non-conforming, or other\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Example : if someone identifies as a man and a trans man, their data are like:\n\n    -   $I(Gender = \\text{Male/Man only}) = 0$\n    -   $I(Gender = \\text{Female/Woman only}) = 0$\n    -   $I(Gender = \\text{Trans male/man, trans female/woman, genderqueer/non-conforming, or other}) = 1$\n\n## About confounders and effect modifiers\n\n-   When hypothesizing whether a variable a confounder or effect modifier\n\n    -   Make sure to back any claims in your final report with sources\n\n    -   We can speculate what's at play, but we can't actually know\n\n    -   Our own identity may bias how we perceive specific dynamics\n\n-   Education: I saw many of us speculate that higher education may be associated with lower IAT (as a potential confounder)\n\n    -   Data showed the opposite: higher education, higher mean IAT score\n\n    -   We can think about people's perception of controllability of weight: do people assume certain behaviors about fat people?\n\n        -   Does that align with or go against people's assumptions about behavior needed for higher education?\n\n        -   We also need to think about how education might be linked to socio-economic status, and how that might change what food is affordable\n\n    -   Heavily discussed in Maintenance Phase podcast, but I don't have direct sources\n\n## Potential effect modifier from plots\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n![](Lab_3/EMM.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::: column\n![](Lab_3/EMM2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Notes on plotting\n\n-   `scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 10))`: use this to wrap the text on x-axis\n\n    -   Student used this and I loved it!\n\n-   Keep your explanatory variable on the x-axis when you are plottinf three variables at once\n\n-   `hjust` and `vjust` will move your text on the x axis so it does not cover your plot\n\n-   Plotting age vs. IAT\n\n    -   `geom_smooth()` to show moving mean value\n\n    -   Boxplots and plotting each mean not exactly right for continuous variables\n\n    -   See Lab 4 for how I plot this!\n\n-   In `geom_smooth()`, when to use `method = lm`\n\n    -   Do not use if trying to see how data look\n\n## As we go into Lab 4 and Project Report\n\n-   If IAT score ranges from -2 to 2, what changes in mean IAT is a lot?\n\n    -   0.05: about 1.25% change\n    -   0.5: about 12.5% change\n\n-   A lot of the coefficients may be significant, but are they clinically meaningful?\n",
