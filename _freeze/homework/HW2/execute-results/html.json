The researchers prospectively tracked whether or not the women developed a myocardial infarction (MI) over a 3-year period. The table below summarizes their results with columns indicating whether or not women developed MI and rows indicating their OC use. \n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table data-quarto-disable-processing=\"true\" class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Yes </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> No </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> OC users </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4987 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Non-OC users </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9993 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Part a\nCompute the estimated risk difference comparing OC users to non-OC users. Include a 95% CI for the estimate and interpretation of the estimated value. \n\n\n#### Part b\nCompute the estimated relative risk comparing OC users to non-OC users. Include a 95% CI for the estimate and interpretation of the estimated value. \n\n\n#### Part c\nCompute the estimated odds ratio comparing OC users to non-OC users. Include a 95% CI for the estimate and interpretation of the estimated value. \n\n#### Part d\nIs the OR a good approximation of the RR? Explain why or why not. \n\n### Question 2\nOne important aspect of medical diagnosis is its reproducibility. Suppose that two different doctors examine 100 patients for dyspnea in a respiratory-disease clinic, and that doctor A diagnosed 15 patients as having dyspnea (while doctor B did not), doctor B diagnosed 10 patients as having dyspnea (while doctor A did not), and both doctor A and doctor B diagnosed 7 patients as having dyspnea. \n\n#### Part a\nConstruct a two-way contingency table to summarize the dyspnea diagnoses from doctor A and B.\n\n#### Part b\nCompute the Cohen's kappa, 95% confidence interval, and interpret the results. What level of agreement does your kappa indicate?\n\n### Question 3\nThis question is meant to emphasize the differences between linear regression and logistic regression. Each part will ask about different aspects of the two regression models. If the question has multiple choice answers, then you must write 1-2 sentences justifying your answer.\n\n\n#### Part a\nIn **linear** regression, what type of variable is our response/outcome variable?\n\na. binary\nb. continuous\nc. count\nd. ordinal\n\n\n#### Part b\nIn **logistic** regression, what type of variable is our response/outcome variable?\n\na. binary\nb. continuous\nc. count\nd. normal\n\n\n#### Part c\nWhat assumptions in linear regression? Please state the assumption name and characteristics of that assumption.\n\n#### Part d\n\nWhich assumptions of linear regression are violated if we try to fit a binary response using linear regression? You may choose more than one answer.\n\na. Independence\nb. Linearity\nc. Normality\nd. Homoscedasticity\n\n\n#### Part e\nPlease use our notes on generalized linear models (GLMs) to answer this question. What is the random component used in linear regression? What is the random component used in logistic regression? Name the specific variable type and distribution for it.\n\n#### Part f\nPlease use our notes on generalized linear models (GLMs) to answer this question. What link function do we use in linear regression? What link function do we use in logistic regression? Name the link and write out the function.\n\n\n#### Part g\nPlease use our notes on generalized linear models (GLMs) to answer this question. What is the systematic component used in simple linear regression? What is the systematic component used in simple logistic regression? Please write out the function for the systematic component for a single covariate. \n\n\n#### Part h\nHow do we determine our coefficient estimates (estimates of the parameter values) in linear regression? You may choose more than one answer.\n\na. Ordinary least squares\nb. Maximum likelihood estimation\n\n\n#### Part i\nHow do we determine our coefficient estimates (estimates of the parameter values) in logistic regression? You may choose more than one answer.\n\na. Ordinary least squares\nb. Maximum likelihood estimation\n\n### Question 4\n\nThis question is taken from the Hosmer and Lemeshow textbook. The ICU study data set consists of a sample of 200 subjects who were part of a much larger study on survival of patients following admission to an adult intensive care unit (ICU). The dataset should be available within Course Materials. The major goal of this study was to develop a logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival to hospital discharge of these patients. In this question, the primary outcome variable is vital status at hospital discharge, STA. Clinicians associated with the study felt that a key determinant of survival was the patient’s age at admission, AGE.\n\nA code sheet for the variables to be considered is displayed in Table 1.5 below (from the Hosmer and Lemeshow textbook, pg. 23). We refer to this data set as the ICU data.\n\n![](./images/ICU_codebook.png)\n\n#### Part a\n\nWrite down the equation for the logistic regression model of STA on AGE. What characteristic of the outcome variable, STA, leads us to consider the logistic regression model as opposed to the usual linear regression model to describe the relationship between STA and AGE?\n\n\n#### Part b\n\nWrite down an expression for the log-likelihood for the logistic regression model in Part a. This will me a mathematical expression. Please do not use generic expressions like $\\pi(X)$, instead replace $X$ with the specific variables in this question. \n\n\n#### Part c\n\nUsing the `glm()` function, obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficient parameters of the logistic regression model in Part a. Using these estimates, write down fitted logistic regression model.\n\n#### Part d\nUse the Wald test to test whether or not the intercept ($\\beta_0$) of the logistic regression model is significantly different from 0. Make sure to include your: hypothesis test, code/work leading to the computed test statistic, output including the test statistic and p-value, and conclusion. Please refer to the Additional Tips to guide you on what a complete/correct answer contains. \n\n\n#### Part e\nUse the Likelihood Ratio test to test whether or not the coefficient for age ($\\beta_1$) of the logistic regression model is significantly different from 0. Make sure to include your: hypothesis test, code/work leading to the computed test statistic, output including the test statistic and p-value, and conclusion. Please refer to the Additional Tips to guide you on what a complete/correct answer contains. **You do not need to include an interpretation of the coefficient since we have not covered this.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
