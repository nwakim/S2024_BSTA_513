Then you can load it here!\n\n### Restate your research question\n\n::: callout-important\n##### Task\n\nPlease restate your research question below using the provided format. It's repetitive, but it helps me contextualize my feedback as I look through your lab.\n:::\n\nHow is implicit anti-fat bias, as measured by the IAT score, associated with \"insert main independent variable here\"?\n\n### Step 1: Simple linear regressions / analysis\n\nWe have done most of this step through visualizations in Lab 2 and 3. Now, we will quickly run a simple linear regression model for each covariate against the IAT score (outcome). Remember, the goal of this is to see if each covariate explains enough variation of the outcome, IAT score. You should have at least 9 simple linear regression models and their results. Results include the F-statistic and p-value from the test if each covariate explains enough variation of the outcome. Please revisit the slides from Lesson 5 (SLR: More inference + Evaluation) for more help with this test. \n\n::: callout-warning\n## VERY IMPORTANT FOR VARIABLES WE ORDERED USING FACTOR!!\n\nI asked that you order variables to make plots more interpretable. However, for the `lm()`, R reads the ordered variables in an unexpected way. For these variables to run correctly in R, we need to unorder the variables. We can also set a reference level that makes sense. \n\nFor example, I may want to unorder my variable `iam_001` and set the reference to `Neither underweight nor overweight`. I can do this with:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niat_2021_new = iat_2021_old %>% \n  mutate(iam_unordered = factor( iam_ordered, ordered = FALSE ) %>% \n           relevel( ref = \"Neither underweight nor overweight\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nRecall, we mentioned 3 options to running and outputting the results of \n\n1.    We can run `lm()` for each covariate *in separate lines of code*, and use something like `summary()` or `anova()` to look at the results of each. (More time consuming to write, but less complicated coding)\n2.    We can use `lapply()` to run `lm()` and display the `anova()` on each covariate *in one line of code*. (Less time consuming to write, but more complicated coding, and more prone to errors that may not be apparent from output)\n3.    We can use `sapply()` to run `lm()`, `anova()`, and display the p-value for each covariate *in one line of code*. (Less time consuming to write, but more complicated coding, more prone to errors that may not be apparent from output, and no sense of what's going on in the regression)\n\nPlease take a note for yourself if your dataset contains the original numeric versions of variables that we created factors for. I am not saying that you should take them out. They might be useful if our sample is not big enough to handle all the categorical covariates that we've included, but I think our sample is large enough. \n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\n1.  Run a simple linear regression model for each covariate against the IAT score (outcome).\n2.  Display results from the test if each covariate explains enough variation of the outcome. This may be from three options in the instructions: `summary()/anova()` only, `lapply()`, or `sapply()`\n\nInterpretation of the results will be in the next step.\n:::\n\n### Step 2: Preliminary variable selection\n\nUsing the previous p-values from the F-test on each covariate's SLR, decide which covariates will be included in the initial model. Recall the decision rule: we keep covariates that explain enough variation using p-value \\< 0.25. Note that because our sample size is so large, the p-values might be really small. For now, that's okay, but this means we may want to alter our Step 3 a little bit. \n\nOnce you have decided on the covariates, run the model and display the regression table. \n\n::: callout-important\n#### Tasks\n\n1.    Decide which covariates will be included in the initial model and list them. \n2.    Run the initial model and display the regression table.\n\nNo need to write out the model, but you may *in addition* to the list. \n:::\n\n### Step 3: Assess change in coefficient\n\nNow that all the selected variables are in one initial model, we can start considering the effect of each variable (outside of our main research question). \n\nRemember our general rule: We can remove a variable if (1) p-value \\> 0.05 for the F-test to include or exclude the variable and (2) change in coefficient ($\\Delta\\%$) of our explanatory variable is \\< 10%. \n\nSince our sample size is quite large, most of the p-values will be quite small. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
