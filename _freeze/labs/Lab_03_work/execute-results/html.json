Restate your research question\n\n::: callout-important\n##### Task\n\nPlease restate your research question below using the following format. It's repetitive, but it helps me contextualize my feedback as I look through your lab.\n:::\n\nHow is implicit anti-fat bias, as measured by the IAT score, associated with \"insert main independent variable here\"?\n\n### 1. Working with multi-selection variables\n\nIn the list of variables that we may choose to work with (in Lab 2), there are two that allowed respondents to select multiple categories. The two variables are `genderIdentitiy` and `raceombmulti`. **If you did not choose these variables to work with, you may skip this section.**\n\n### 2. Continuing data exploration\n\nbivariate data exploration\n\n-   Look at all other relationships between IAT score and each covariate.\n\n    -   For categorical variables, is there an inherent order? Does the ordered values follow a linear relationship? Are the categories evenly spaced? Think education - is there a natural place to divide the categories up?? multivariate data exploration\n\n### 3. Make a Table 1\n\n### 4. Fit the simple linear regression\n\n### 5.\n",
