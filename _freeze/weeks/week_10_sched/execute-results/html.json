I just need to take a serious look at my calendar\n\n        -   I'm attending a virtual stat ed conference, so I just need to balance meetings with conference attendance\n\n-   No office hours this Wednesday 6/5\n\n-   **#3 “The Last Bounce: Bunnies, Burritos, and DIY Bath Salts”**\n\n    -   **Wednesday, June 5^th^ Noon-2pm**\n\n    -   **Student Success Center, 6^th^ floor Vanport**\n\n### Wednesday 6/5\n\n-   Last day of lecture!!\n\n-   Quiz 2: added 3 points to everyone's grade for that one confusing question (I forget the number, maybe question 6?)\n\n-   Lab 4\n\n    -   Your starting variables should be the TEN from lab 2, not the 5 from Lab 3\n\n    -   g-value for Hosmer-Lemeshow test\n\n        -   Please look at Lesson 12!! There is a note on how to pick the g-value when we have many samples!!\n\n        -   Some of us are getting NA's when we put the correct `g`\n\n    -   \n\n-   The class will end on June 14, 2024. **All coursework is expected to be completed by June 16, 2024 at 11pm.**\n\n    -   I need to have grades in on June 21st. In order to grade fairly and thoroughly, I need the whole week to grade the project report and any late assignments.\n\n-   [A word on project grading](https://nwakim.github.io/S2024_BSTA_513/project/Project_report_instructions.html#grading)\n\n    -   In the final lab, I gave you the option to do LASSO regression and focus on prediction. I know this created some confusion since we mostly set up the project as a question of association in Lab 1-3. We can still interpret the odds ratios from LASSO regression. I will be fairly lenient if reports are confused between prediction and association aims. I will try to give feedback on it, but I will not penalize any minor confusions.\n\n        Another word: My process starts harsh. I want to give you as much feedback as possible, and this will also reflect in lower assigned scores. At this point, I put the report grades into Sakai. I check to see if anyone's overall course letter grade goes down. If less than \\~5 course grades go down, then I revisit their project reports. If their report fails to demonstrate the most important learning objectives from the course, then I will keep the lower grade. If they demonstrate an understanding of the most important learning objectives, then I will adjust their score to increase their course grade. If more than 5 grades go down, then I revisit everyone's reports. I will make a class wide grade bump in all reports.\n\n    -   The most important learning objectives are: understanding when and what test is appropriate, and interpreting odds ratios (from main effects and interactions)\n\n-   Project: LASSO\n\n    -   You can take the finalized formula for LASSO and use it in `glm()`\n\n        -   In this case, use the test data to come up with predictive values (like AUC)\n\n        -   You can run it on the full dataset to get the coefficient estimates and other diagnostic information\n\n-   [Guide on figures](https://nwakim.github.io/S2024_BSTA_513/project/Project_report_instructions.html#guide-on-figures)\n\n## Class Exit Tickets\n\n[[{{< iconify healthicons health-worker-form-negative size=30px >}}](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=V3lz4rj6fk2U9pvWr59xWFMopmPUjRtDiHLswhgacNhUMkFER0lXTDdTUzIxN1A1QkJWUUVDNkRNRC4u)]{style=\"color:#f8f5f0;\"} Monday (6/3)\n\n[[{{< iconify healthicons health-worker-form-negative size=30px >}}](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=V3lz4rj6fk2U9pvWr59xWFMopmPUjRtDiHLswhgacNhURFlUQUhaRURCTEJVVlBKUEc5RDhCN04zQS4u)]{style=\"color:#f8f5f0;\"} Wednesday (6/5)\n\n## Muddiest Points\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
