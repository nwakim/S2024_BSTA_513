Click on the icon with three horizontal bars on the bottom left of the browser.\n2.  Click on \"Tools\" with the gear icon at the top of the sidebar.\n3.  Click on \"PDF Export Mode.\"\n4.  From there, you can print or save the PDF as you would normally from your internet browser.\n    1.  For example, in Chrome: I would click on the 3 vertical dots in the top right corner, then click Print, then change the Destination to \"Save as PDF.\"\n    2.  It doesn't seem to work well in Safari... Let me know if you're having trouble.\n\n## Announcements\n\n### Monday 1/8\n\n-   We came from two different sections of the same course\n    -   While I am confident we all learned a lot and mostly the same material\n    -   We definitely learned it in different ways\n    -   Three components of 511/512/513\n        -   Theory\n        -   Application\n        -   Coding\n-   There is a workshop on Friday, 1/12\n    -   [Data Equity Primer](https://weallcount.com/the-data-equity-primer/) from We All Count\n    -   ~~If you attend, I will give you an extra 3% on your project report.~~\n    -   Unfortunately, I was in contact with the workshop, but they cannot offer free seats to the whole class.\n    -   I am attending, and will try to see if I can share a recording afterwards!\n-   Here are a few resources if youâ€™d like to practice R:\n    -   [https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCq7ufpNjA$ \"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCq7ufpNjA$\")\n    -   [https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/r-bootcamp.netlify.app/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCqkZiESbE$ \"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/r-bootcamp.netlify.app/__;!!Mi0JBg!IBoZPEa58_qilCqExXMIk05vR_PoK6BO5kH5n48vdJXKPK6dpuLSP4QwMqxk2n11HgCpsLCqkZiESbE$\")\n        -   This is step by step, and lets you practice your code in real time\n        -   We will use `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr` extensively in this class!\n        -   I am happy to help with coding, but during our class time our focus will by statistics topics\n            -   Coding help will mostly be done outside of class time\n-   We will also be using an attachment within Rstudio called Quarto\n    -   Here is a great tutorial on Quarto: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html>\n        -   Mine is the Quarto queen!\n\n        -   There is some expectation of knowledge with the above packages (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`)\n\n### Wednesday 1/10\n\n## On the Horizon\n\n-   [Homework 0 due 1/11](../homework/HW0.qmd)\n\n## Class Exit Tickets\n\n[[{{< iconify healthicons health-worker-form-negative size=30px >}}](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=V3lz4rj6fk2U9pvWr59xWFMopmPUjRtDiHLswhgacNhUNEU3TkZQUjdEMElYQVpWRUc4UkVDSVBMNy4u)]{style=\"color:#f8f5f0;\"} Monday (1/8)\n\n[[{{< iconify healthicons health-worker-form-negative size=30px >}}](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=V3lz4rj6fk2U9pvWr59xWFMopmPUjRtDiHLswhgacNhUODlaWDJPNzQxRVhaOFVDVUhOU1oxRTlTUC4u)]{style=\"color:#f8f5f0;\"} Wednesday (1/10)\n\n## Additional Information\n\nAs we start the course, here are some administrative items that we need to do:\n\n-   Please join the Slack page\n-   Please read the syllabus on your own time\n\n## Statistician of the Week: Regina Nuzzo\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-4\n\n::: {.cell preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Regina Nuzzo](../images/stat_of_week/nuzzo.jpg){fig-alt='Image credit: Regina Nuzzo https://www.reginanuzzo.com/'}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: g-col-8\nDr. Nuzzo received her PhD in Statistics from Stanford University and is now Professor of Science, Technology, & Mathematics at <a href = \"https://gallaudet.edu/\" target = \"_blank\">Gallaudet University</a>.

Relationship between distributions\n\nJust to clarify! We will be using the distributions in the context of hypothesis testing. I just wanted you to see some of the cool connections between the distributions. (We don't need to know the connections for a lot of what we do in this class.)\n\nAlso, I will discuss each distribution again as we hit the hypothesis tests that use them!\n\nThere is a big, scary (but fun!) infographic at the end of a famous stat textbook (Casella and Berger) that shows all the connections between distributions:\n\n![](week_01/CB_distributions.png)\n\nWe mostly talk about the red, circled area. Each line with the directional arrow represents a specific transformation that is needed to go from the starting distribution to the distribution at the end of the arrow.\n\n**Again, this is NOT information we need to perform regression, but it is really interesting to see the connections between these distributions.**\n\n### 2. A word about the distributions\n\nI feel like I might've scared us with all the distribution talk.\n\nI want to be clear: We will further discuss and explore the distributions as we use them within the course. It will be more important **to understand their use within regression** then knowing the distribution in depth. **Basically, when we implement specific hypothesis tests, we just need to know which distribution is most appropriate for the test.**\n\n### 3. Is the F distribution used for things outside of ANOVA?\n\nYes! In regression, we often use the F-distribution through the F-test (same as ANOVA) However, in regression, we are comparing the variance of two models, that may differ by a coefficient. [See the STAT 501 page for more info if interested.](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/6/6.2) In ANOVA, we are comparing variance between and within groups. Both use the same test, but with different goals!\n\n### 4. Multivariable vs multivariate?\n\nSome people misuse \"multivariate\" instead of \"multivariable\" modeling. In this class, we will only look at multivariable regression. Here's the big difference:\n\n-   **Multivariable:** model with **multiple independent variables** (covariates, predictors)\n    -   If we want to see how our outcome (height) is related to parent height, birth country, sex assigned at birth, etc.\n-   **Multivariate:** model with **multiple dependent variables** (outcome)\n    -   If we want to extend the outcome from height to height and head circumference. Multivariate modeling would try to model both outcomes together and see how they are related to other variables.\n",
