Why do we need to create a new variable for ordinal / scoring?\n\nOtherwise R will treat income as non-ordinal, and use the default reference cell coding. So if we want our variables to be scored (and numeric) then we must put it in a form R can recognize.\n\n### 2. I'm a little confused on how the R code works for recoding/reordering our variables, specifically 1) why we use the mutate function but then use the same name for the variable/how that works and 2) why you need to include the list of each variable name in a vector. Basically, what each piece of that code does exactly and why it's needed.\n\n1.  Mutate is just a function to create/change a variable. So if we are not fundamentally changing any aspect of the variable, we can call it by the same name. Helps keep our data frame neat by not tacking on additional variables.\n\n2.  When I am including the list of levels I am giving R the exact order to read each level. So if I want to go from high income to low income, I would reset the levels to the below code. Then R would read high income as the first level.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    gapm2 = gapm2 %>%\n     mutate(income_levels = factor(income_levels, \n                ordered = T, \n                levels = c(\"High income\", \n                           \"Upper middle income\", \n                           \"Lower middle income\", \n                           \"Low income\")))\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n### 3. Is there a rationale or strategy in choosing the most appropriate reference group?\n\nOften no, not if the groups are not ordered. Things that you may consider:\n\n-   Is there a central group that you want to make comparisons to?\n\n-   Is there any social consequences of continually centering comparisons to one group? We may be consequentially centering the narrative around that group.\n\n-   When we interpret the coefficients, is there one group as the reference that makes it a little easier to interpret? (this has more of an effect in 513)\n\n### 4. How do we build the regression indicators?\n\nIn R, we don't need to build the indicators. If we have a variable that is a facotr with mutually exclusive groups, then R will automatically create the indicators within the `lm()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
