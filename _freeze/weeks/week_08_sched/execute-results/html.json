Thus, once we get to interpreting ORs, we can just say \"unmet care.\"\n\n        -   Also, correct for including a list of the variables that you are adjusting for!\n\n            -   But again, we hopefully defined our final model and specifically mentioned the variables that we are adjusting for\n\n            -   Thus, once we get to our interpretation, we can say something more like \"adjusting for the previously listed variables in our model\"\n\n    -   For output of \\`tbl_regression()\\` make sure to edit the variable names into more common language\n\n        -   `set_variable_labels()` [from tibbleOne package might help!](https://rdrr.io/cran/tibbleOne/man/set_variable_labels.html)\n\n## Class Exit Tickets\n\n[[{{< iconify healthicons health-worker-form-negative size=30px >}}](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=V3lz4rj6fk2U9pvWr59xWFMopmPUjRtDiHLswhgacNhUNzhJTkoyOEtZNEExQjQ1U1hIVTM4UTJKMy4u)]{style=\"color:#f8f5f0;\"} Monday (5/20)\n\n[{{< iconify healthicons health-worker-form-negative size=30px >}}]{style=\"color:#f8f5f0;\"} Wednesday (5/22)\n\n## Muddiest Points / Questions\n\n### 1. How did you determine the ages for the R output on slide 24 (standardized deviance residuals)\n\nThe centered ages are centered around the mean age. A few classes ago I mentioned that the mean was 69 years old, might have gotten lost in this lesson. So calculating the actual ages is just adding the mean age and centered age. So centered age of 6 is 69+6 = 75. Also, very confusing because apparently I can't add!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### \n",
