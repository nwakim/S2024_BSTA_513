## Directions

**This homework must be turned into Sakai. I want to make sure we are all familiar with the process of downloading a `.qmd`** file, editing it, and resubmitting an `.html` and `.qmd` file.

Here are the instructions for downloading and submitting your homework:

1.  Go to [this github site](https://github.com/nwakim/W2024_BSTA_512/blob/main/homework/HW0.qmd) to download the homework's `.qmd` file.

2.  When you reach the site, it should look like this:![](HW0/HW0_github.png)

3.  Click the "Download raw file" icon (![](HW0/download_icon.png){width="25"}) to download the `.qmd` file. This will likely download the file into your "Downloads" folder. It is up to you to move the file into the appropriate folder.

4.  Please rename you homework as `Lastname_Firstinitial_HW0.qmd` . This will help organize the homeworks when the TAs grade them.

5.  Please also add the following line under `subtitle: "BSTA 512/612"`: `author: First-name Last-name` with your first and last name so it is attached to the viewable document.

6.  Edit the document with your explanations and code. If you are writing out an answer or calculating by hand, you can take a picture of your work and embed it within the `.qmd` file. The pictures will be viewable on the `.html` file.

7.  Please upload your homework to this Sakai assignment. **Upload both your `.qmd` code file and the rendered `.html` file**.

These instructions will not appear on every homework. You may come back to this page for reference.

### Purpose

This homework is meant to introduce yourself to me and your peers. In the first class, we will all briefly introduce ourselves, but we don't have enough time in-depth introductions. Thus, I'd like you to share some information with the class over Slack.

### Grading

Grading will be done as a check/no check for turning in your work. If you are stressed about time, please turn in whatever you have completed.

## Questions

### Question 1

Please upload a picture of yourself [to Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bsta512613w2024/shared_invite/zt-29g7biioz-XhPs~tj8xwL1GajEw9YlTg). Please follow the below steps to add a picture of yourself in Slack:

1.  Go to the top right corner in Slack and click your profile picture.
2.  Click "Profile."
3.  In the picture of the clip art person, click "Upload Photo" in top right corner.
4.  Upload a picture file of yourself.

*Please include the picture you used below. This will make sure we are all able to insert a picture within Quarto. It will also make sure I can see the photo within the `.html` file.*

### Question 2

Provide a pronunciation of your name: Please follow the below steps to add an audio and written pronunciation of your name in Slack:

1.  Go to the top right corner in Slack and click your profile picture.
2.  Click "Profile."
3.  To the right of your name, click "Edit."
4.  Under "Name Recording," click "Record Audio Clip."
5.  Please say your name once at a normal pace then once slowly. Please listen to my audio for an example.
6.  You may also edit the written pronunciation of your name. This is optional. I realize that doing this is may require a lot of time researching phonetics.

### Question 3

Please complete the [following whenisgood poll](https://whenisgood.net/53kgg2b) so that we can schedule office hours. Please use a unique identifier (does not have to be your name), so that I can make sure each student can attend at least one office hour.

### Question 4

Completion of this question is optional. If you are comfortable sharing your pronouns, please edit your name in Slack to include them. For example, I have changed my name to be "Nicky Wakim (she/her)". If you prefer to not share your pronouns, then I will refer to you using they/them pronouns.

### Question 5

Please post an introduction in the `#random` channel on Slack. You ***do not need*** to include all of the below items, but your introduction ***may*** include information like:

-   Preferred name
-   Pronouns
-   Are you new to Portland?
-   Career interests
-   Hobbies
-   Family, children, and/or fur babies
-   Favorite/recent adventures, restaurants, TV shows, books, podcasts, games, etc.
-   Willingness to join a study group
-   Motivation for taking the course
-   Anticipated Winter trip/activity
-   Any resolutions/vibes/outlooks that you are thinking about as we start the new calendar year/quarter

Please feel free to get creative with what you share! You don't need to adhere to this list.

### Question 6

Completion of this question is only necessary if you have accommodations. If you have any learning accommodations, please email me about your needs. I should receive a direct email from the Office of Student Access, but it is important that we discuss how accommodations will translate to our class.
