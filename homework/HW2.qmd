## Directions

-   [Download the `.qmd` file here.](https://github.com/nwakim/W2024_BSTA_512/blob/main/homework/HW2.qmd)

-   You will need to download the datasets. Use [this link to download](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/Documents/Teaching/Classes/W2024_BSTA_512_612/Student_files/Data/Homework?csf=1&web=1&e=QEsqb9) the homework datasets needed in this assignment. If you do not want to make changes to the paths set in this document, then make sure the files are stored in a folder named "data" that is housed in the same location as this homework `.qmd` file.

-   Please upload your homework to [Sakai](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/BSTA-512-1-AB-W24/tool/961ec5ef-d7f9-4518-be16-25f7af3d6be4). **Upload both your `.qmd` code file and the rendered `.html` file**

-   For each question, make sure to include all code and resulting output in the html file to support your answers.

-   Show the work of your calculations using R code within a code chunk. Make sure that both your code and output are visible in the rendered html file. This is the default setting.

-   If you are computing something by hand, you may take a picture of your work and insert the image in this file. You may also use LaTeX to write it inline.

-   Write all answers in complete sentences as if communicating the results to a collaborator. This means including a sentence summarizing results in the context of the research study.

    -   Questions **not requiring a sentence are**
        -   Ch 7 \# 1, 2, 5
        -   Ch 6 \# 5, 6
        -   Ch 14 \# 2, 12, 14

::: callout-tip
It is a good idea to try rendering your document from time to time as you go along! Note that rendering automatically saves your qmd file and rendering frequently helps you catch your errors more quickly.

## Question 1 

This homework assignment is based on data collected as part of an observational study of patients who suffered from stroke. Dataset: The main goal was to study various psychological factors: optimism, fatalism, depression, spirituality, and their relationship with stroke severity and other health outcomes among the study participants. Data were collected using questionnaires during a baseline interview and also medical chart review. More information about this study can be found in the article Fatalism, Optimism, Spirituality, Depressive Symptoms and Stroke Outcome: A population based analysis published in the journal Stroke (2011; 42: 3518-3523). The article can be found on the course website.

The dataset that you will work with is called Completedata. It is SIMILAR but does not exactly match the data in the article. It contains information on complete cases (i.e. excludes participants who had missing data on one or more variables of interest) who suffered a stroke. The variables Optimism (higher=more optimism), Fatalism (higher=feels less control of their life), Depression (higher is more depressed), Spirituality (higher is more belief in a higher power) are variables generated from the observational study. For our homework purposes we will assume they are continuous. NIHScore is the NIH Stroke Severity score, with low numbers representing mild stroke, and larger number more severe stroke, and will also be assumed continuous. Notice that the assumptions in linear regression do not require X to be continuous.

### Part a 

Obtain a scatterplot, with title and axis labels, Depression (y-axis) vs. Fatalism (x-axis). Comment on what you see.

### Part b

Fit a linear regression model to estimate the association between the predictor Fatalism and the outcome Depression (do this using proc reg in SAS, or lm() in R), and interpret the association in plain language. (\textbf{Note}: Please provide interpretation on both point estimates [coefficients] and inference [either F or t test].) 

### Part c

Re-do b) with your own code (either SAS proc iml, in R, or other). Submit your code.

### Part d
Obtain the interquartile range (IQR) for fatalism (IQR is Q3-Q1). Make a new variable FatalismIQR, equal to Fatalism centered at its median, and divided by the IQR. This is an alternative way of standardizing a variable, and can be used for variables that have symmetric or skewed distribution. Re-run the regression from (b) using this new variable, and interpret its coefficient. Which of the following are the same as in 1b: intercept, slope? (\textbf{Note}: Please provide by-hand calculation of both point estimates [coefficients] and inference [either F or t test].) 

## Chapter 7

<font color="green">Use the data from Chapter 5 Question 9 to answer the following questions. Use the log-transformed values as given in the dataset.</font>

<font color="darkorange">Note: the question numbers below do not refer to questions from the textbook. Complete the problems below instead of the ones in the book.</font>



### (1)

<font color="green">Use R to create the ANOVA table for the regression described in the exercise.</font>



### (2)

<font color="green">Using the values in the `Df` and `Sum Sq` columns, show how the remaining values in the table are calculated.</font>

### (3)

<font color="green">Calculate the SSY and its degrees of freedom. Use these values to calculate the standard deviation of the outcome variable. </font>



### (4)

<font color="green">What are the hypotheses being tested in the ANOVA table? Make sure to include a description of the parameter being tested in the context of the research question.</font>


### (5)

<font color="green">Using just the values in the ANOVA table, find the value of the t-distribution test statistic for testing the slope that one would find in the regression output of the linear model. What are the degrees of freedom for that t-distribution?</font>

### (6)

<font color="green">Show the regression output for the linear model. Using just the regression output, calculate the SSR and SSE values in the ANOVA table.</font>

## Question 1 (chapter 6)

<font color="green">Use the data from Chapter 5 Question 9 to answer the following questions. Use the log-transformed values as given in the dataset.</font>

<font color="darkorange">Note: the question numbers below do not refer to questions from the textbook. Complete the problems below instead of the ones in the book.</font>

### (1)

<font color="green">Create a scatterplot of the dependent and independent variables, and in words describe the their relationship. Is it reasonable to use a linear regression to model the relationship?</font>

### (2)

<font color="green">Find the correlation coefficient between the two variables. Is the value consistent with your description of the relationship in the previous question? Why or why not?</font>

### (3)

<font color="green">Test whether the two variables are significantly correlated. Do this using the formula and then check your work with R's test for correlations. Make sure to include the hypotheses and a conclusion. </font>

### (4)

<font color="green">Calculate the confidence interval for $\rho$ using the formula and verify that it matches the confidence interval in R's test output. Include an interpretation of the confidence interval and also explain why the confidence interval is consistent with the p-value.</font>

### (5)

<font color="green">Calculate the coefficient of determination using the ANOVA table output, and confirm that it matches the value in the R output (what R output shows this and what is it labeled as?). </font>

### (6)

<font color="green">What is another way to calculate the coefficient of determination? Do the calculation and verify that you have the same answer.</font>

### (7)

<font color="green">Give an interpretation of the coefficient of determination in the context of the study.</font>

<font color="darkorange">Note: the question numbers below do not refer to questions from the textbook. Complete the problems below instead of the ones in the book.</font>
