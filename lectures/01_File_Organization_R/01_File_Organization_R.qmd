## Using OneDrive

-   We all have free access to OneDrive to store files

-   [Let's login](https://login.microsoftonline.com/) into our online accounts

-   [You can also download OneDrive for your desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download)

    -   Allows you to access the OneDrive from your computer's interface instead of the browser

    -   Creates a link between your computer and the cloud!

-   Let me show you mine

    -   I can access all the files through RStudio as well!

-   Let's take a couple minutes to log into OneDrive

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(5)
```

## Folder organization

-   Make these folders in your computer

    -   Only make them in OneDrive **if** you have a desktop connection

::: columns
::: column
-   For a project, I usually have the following folders

    -   Background
    -   Code
    -   Data_Raw
    -   Data_Processed
    -   Dissemination
    -   Reports
    -   Meetings
:::

::: column
-   For our class, I suggest making one folder for the course with the following folders in it:

    -   Data
    -   Homework
    -   Notes
    -   Project
    -   Quizzes
    -   And other folders if you want
:::
:::

-   Take a few minutes to create these folders

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(5)
```

## Now download some data from my the OneDrive

-   Go into the [Student files folder](https://ohsuitg-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wakim_ohsu_edu/EsWSKGeK3PZMrjgzBfKpossBoG_UhC_kxmeJEoiyWkn7aQ?e=crBe5N)

-   Download the dataset in Sample_folder, under Data

-   Create your own Sample_folder under Notes

    -   Save the dataset there

-   Alternatively, you can download all of Sample_folder and then put that under Notes

## Creating project in RStudio

-   Way to designate a working directory: basically your home base when working in R

    -   We have to tell R exactly where we are in our folders and where to find other things

    -   A project makes it easier to tell R where we are

-   Basic steps to create a project

    -   Go into RStudio

    -   Create new project for this class (under `File` or top right corner)

-   Once we have projects, we can open one are R will automatically know that its location is the start of our working directory

-   Let me show you my process

    -   I will create one in my Sample_folder

    -   I will show you how I switch between classes

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(5)
```

## Creating a new `qmd` file

-   Basic steps

    -   Create new `.qmd` (under `File` or top left corner)

    -   Decide on document types/options

-   Let me show you my process

-   Create a `.qmd` in your Sample_folder under any folder (maybe Notes is good)

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(5)
```

## Looking at `Source` vs. `Visual`

## Here package

::: columns
::: column
-   [Good source for the `here` package](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/how-to-use-the-here-package/)

-   Just substitute `.Rmd` with `.qmd`

-   Basically, a `.qmd` file and `.R` file work differently

    -   We haven't worked much with `.R` files

-   For `.qmd` files, the automatic directory is the folder it is in

    -   But we want it to be the main project folder

-   `here` can help with that
:::

## Install `here` package

-   Install `here` package: you can do this in your console (not inside `.qmd` file)

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("here")
```

-   Within your console, type `here()` and enter

    -   Try this with `getwd()` as well

## Using `here()` to load data

-   There `here()` function will start at the working directory (where your `.Rproj` file is) and let you write out a file path for anything

-   To load the dataset in our `.qmd` file, we will use:

```{r}
#| eval: false
data = read_excel(here("./Data/CH05Q01.xls"))
data = read_excel(here("Data", "CH05Q01.xls"))
```

::: definition
::: def-title
Watch out when using lubridate package simultaneously
:::

::: def-cont
Use `here::here()` if you have `lubridate` loaded within same `.qmd`. This will tell R to use the function `here()` within the `here` package instead of `lubridate`'s `here()` function. To call lubridate's function, we'd use `lubridate::here()`
