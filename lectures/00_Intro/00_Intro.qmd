## Course Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, students should be able to...

1.  Apply and interpret some hypothesis-testing procedures for two-way and three-way **contingency tables**

2.  Compute and **interpret measures of association** for **binary and ordinal data**.

3.  Calculate and correctly interpret **odds ratios using logistic regression**, make comparison across groups and examine relationship between binary outcome and predictor variables.

4.  Apply appropriate **model-building strategies for logistic regression**. Effectively use statistical computing packages for contingency table and logistic regression procedures.

5.  Perform **Poisson regression** analysis using count data and interpret model estimates, make comparison across groups and examine relationship between outcome and predictor variables.

6.  Coherently **summarize methods and results of data analyses**, and discuss in context of original health-related research questions to audiences with varied statistical background.

## New way to record/view lectures

-   I will be using Echo360 to automatically record time from 1-3pm in this room!

-   It will be LIVE

    -   So you can watch in real time, but won't be able to interact with us

    -   Might have a 10 second lag

    -   No need to tell me if you cannot make class

-   [Here is the link to our site!](https://echo360.org/section/3d2de378-ed40-415a-8caf-8c75f3b5d9ff/public) I'll keep posting it on the weekly pages

    -   Currently a public link, but working on getting everyone an account so we can make it private

-   I don't have to post anything after class, so no issues with me forgetting to post it

## New Exit ticket style

-   All the questions are optional

-   But still open the link and submit!

-   5 of the exit tickets are dropped!

## Some important tasks

-   [Join the Slack page!](https://join.slack.com/t/bsta513613s24/shared_invite/zt-2fwl1ziz7-K98XEP_8qLEMzagVlzJWbQ)

-   Star the class website: [https://nwakim.github.io/S2024_BSTA_513/](https://nwakim.github.io/W2024_BSTA_512/){.uri}

-   Complete the [WhenIsGood](https://whenisgood.net/y87ezga) for office hours

    -   If your calendar feels set, take 5 mintues to fill this out now!

    -   Complete by Thursday at 11pm!!!

-   Highly suggest that you make an appointment with a learning specialist through [Student Academic Support Services](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/Student_Support)!

## Quizzes

-   Might be delivered slightly differently

-   We will still have the 50 minutes at the end of class to take the quiz

    -   And the quiz should only take 30 minutes

-   However, RPV does not have private rooms for those who need it

-   I am work-shopping ideas on how to deliver the quiz, including:

    -   Take home and turn in on Wednesday

    -   Online vs. on paper

    -   Ways to mitigate cheating

## Homework grading

-   Slightly new grading

-   Now, need to turn in 50% of the homework **completed** to get check mark

-   Noticed that demonstrating understanding in the project was correlated with completing the homework\*

    -   No formal analysis was done on this

    -   And there may be confounders like time available to commit to this class in general

-   Either way, I think practice is the most important tool for learning

    -   So I want to us to practice the work, but I'm trying to balance this with added stress

# Any questions on how this quarter is going to go?

## How to print slides

-   Anyone have issues with this?

    -   I can show how to do it in Chrome and Safari
