## What is Categorical Data Analysis?

-   In BSTA 512/612 (linear regression), we focused on [continuous responses/outcomes]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"}

    -   We included [categorical variables only as covariates]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"} (aka predictors, independent variables, explanatory variables)

    -   Examples from 512/612: life expectancy (in years), IAT score (ranging from -2 to 2)

¬† ¬†

-   Categorical data analysis focuses on the statistical methods for [categorical responses/outcomes]{style="color:#4472C4; font-weight: bold;"}

    -   Explanatory (or ‚Äòindependent‚Äô) variable can be of any type (continuous or categorical)

## Binomial Distribution

-   Consider a sample of $n$ independent trials, each of which can have only two possible outcomes ("success" and "failure")

-   For each trial: $$\begin{align} P( \text{success}) & = p \\
                      P( \text{failure}) & = 1- p = q \end{align}$$

-   **Binomial distribution:** distribution of the number of successes in n independent trials

-   The probability mass function for the binomial distribution is: $$P(X=k) = {n \choose k} p^k q^{n-k}, \text{ for } k = 0, 1, ..., n$$

    -   $E(X) = np$
    -   $Var(X) = npq = np(1-p)$

## Normal Approximation of the Binomial Distribution

-   Also known as: **Sampling distribution of** $\widehat{p}$

-   IF $X\sim \text{Binomial}(n,p)$ and $np>10$ and $nq = n(1-p) > 10$

    -   Ensures sample size ($n$) is moderately large and the $p$ is not too close to 0 or 1
    -   Other resources use other criteria (like $npq>5$ or $np>5$)
    -   When looking at a sample, we use $\widehat{p}$ instead of $p$ to check this!!

¬†

-   THEN approximately $ùëã\sim \text{Normal}\big(\mu_X = np, \sigma_X = \sqrt{np(1-p)} \big)$

    -   Or we often write this as the sampling distribution of $\widehat{p}$: $$\widehat{p} \sim \text{Normal}\bigg(\mu_{\widehat{p}} = p, \sigma_{\widehat{p}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}}\bigg)$$

## Estimate and Confidence Interval of Single Proportion

-   Estimate of proportion:

$$
\widehat{p} = \dfrac{\# \text{successes}}{\# \text{successes} + \# \text{failures}}
$$

-   Use the sampling distribution of $\widehat{p}$ to construct the confidence interval:

    -   $(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for estimate proportion:

$$\begin{align} \widehat{p} &\pm z^*_{(1-\alpha/2)} \cdot SE_{\hat{p}} \\ \widehat{p} &\pm z^*_{(1-\alpha/2)} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \end{align}$$

-   Using $SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ - instead of $\sigma_{p} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ - because we don't know exactly what $p$ is

    -   $(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for estimate difference in proportions:

$$\begin{align} \widehat{p}_1 - \widehat{p}_2 &\pm z^*_{(1-\alpha/2)} \cdot SE_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} \\ \widehat{p}_1 - \widehat{p}_2 &\pm z^*_{(1-\alpha/2)} \cdot \sqrt{
\frac{\hat{p}_1\cdot(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2\cdot(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}} \end{align}$$

-   Using $SE_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1\cdot(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2\cdot(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$ because we don't know exactly what $p_1$ and $p_2$ are

We will be examining the 4-year cumulative incidence of diabetes with one risk factor, glucose tolerance.

¬†

-   **Impaired glucose:** normal or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline visit (between 1988 and 1991)

## McNemar's Test

-   McNemar‚Äôs test should be used if data is from a matched pairs study

¬†

-   What is a matched-pairs study?

    -   Participants are paired based on key characteristics
    -   Each participant within a pair will be assigned to different treatment groups

-   Categorical test that is parallel to the "paired t-test"

¬†

-   R packages and functions

    -   Normal approximation: `mcnemar.test()` in built-in `stats` package
    -   Exact test: `mcnemar.exact()` in `exact2x2` package

¬†

-   **If you would like more information of McNemar‚Äôs test, please see Rosner TB: 10.4 and 10.5: Paired Samples**

## Summary so far

-   Introduced categorical data as the response in analysis
-   Reviewed an important distribution (Binomial distribution) for categorical data analysis
-   Estimated a single proportion from a sample with its confidence interval
-   Estimated a difference in proportions from a sample with its confidence interval

¬† ¬†

-   Can we expand this to ask a more general question about association between a response and explanatory variable?

    -   What if there is more than 2 categories for either variable?

# Learning Objectives

1.  Recognize the motivation for and focus of our course (categorical responses)

2.  Recall features of the Binomial distribution for categorical data analysis and utilize the normal approximation

3.  Determine if a single proportion differs from a population value

4.  Determine if two proportions differ from each other

::: lob
5.  Display data from two categorical variables, each with 2 or more categories, using R X C contingency tables
:::

6.  Determine if a nominal response and nominal explanatory variable are associated with one another using the Chi-squared test

7.  Determine if a nominal response and nominal explanatory variable are associated with one another using the Fisher Exact test

8.  Determine if a binary, nominal response and an ordinal explanatory variable are associated with one another using the Cochran-Armitage test

9.  Determine if an ordinal response and ordinal explanatory variable are associated with one another using the Mantel-Haenszel test

## Contingency Tables (R x C)

-   R X C contingency tables

    -   Contains information for two discrete variables: one has R categories and the other has C categories.

    -   Refers to the number of rows (R) and number of columns (C) in the table

¬†

-   For two proportions: focused on 2 X 2 contingency tables

    -   R = 2, C = 2

¬†

-   Expand our contingency tables to variables with 2 or more categories

    -   Categories can be ordinal or nominal

## Contingency Table: Example

Let's say we are interested in learning the association between the development of breast cancer and age at first birth. Our first step is typically to present the observed data:

![](./images/Conting_tab_ex.png){fig-align="center" width="511"}

-   This is a 2 x 5 contingency table

## Test Association/Trend of R X C Contingency Table

If [both variables are nominal]{style="color:#4472C4; font-weight: bold;"}, a [test of general association]{style="color:#4472C4; font-style: italic;"} will be sufficient

-   Test of general association is the same regardless of R and C
-   Test used for 2x2 contingency table same as 5x3 contingency table
-   We will cover:

    -   Chi-squared test
    -   Fisher Exact test

If [one or both variables are ordinal]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"}, a [test of trend]{style="color:#70AD47; font-style: italic;"} may be of interest

-   Treats ordinal variables as quantitative rather than qualitative (nominal scale)
-   Test of trend has greater power than the test of general association
-   We will cover:

    -   Cochran-Armitage test
    -   Mantel-Haenszel test

## Poll Everywhere Question 4

## Test of General Association

-   **General research question:** Are two variables (both categorical, nominal) associated with each other?

¬†

-   Translated to a hypothesis test:

    -   $H_0$ : There is no association between the two variables / The variables are independent
    -   $H_1$ : There is an association between the two variables / The variables are not independent

¬† ¬†

-   We have two options for testing general association:

    1.  Chi-squared test
    2.  Fisher‚Äôs Exact test

## Test of General Association: SHS Example

-   **Main question:** Do American Indians with impaired glucose tolerance have a different incidence of diabetes?

    -   Is glucose tolerance associated with diabetes incidence among American Indians?

-   We have two variables, and both variables have two nominal categories

    -   Diabetes outcome: Not diabetic and Diabetic
    -   Glucose tolerance: Normal or Impaired
  
¬†

-   Answer research question with a test of general association

-   Hypothesis:

    -   $H_0$ : There is no association between glucose tolerance and diabetes / Glucose tolerance and diabetes are independent
    -   $H_1$ : There is an association between glucose tolerance and diabetes / Glucose tolerance and diabetes are not independent

## Chi-squared test

-   Test to see how likely is it that we observe our data given the null hypothesis (no association)

¬†

-   We use the null to calculate the expected cell counts and compare them to the observed cell counts

¬†

-   Requirements to conduct Chi-squared test (expected cell counts)

    -   For 2 x 2 contingency table:

        -   No expected cell counts should be less than 10

    -   For contingency table with 3x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc.:

        -   No more than 20% of expected cell counts are less than 5
        -   No expected cell counts are less than 1

## Chi-squared test: Process

1.  Check that the [**expected cell counts**]{style="color:#70AD47"} threshold is met

2.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#70AD47"} $\alpha$

3.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

    -   In symbols
    -   In words
    -   Alternative: one- or two-sided?

4.  Calculate the [**test statistic**]{style="color:#70AD47"} and [**p-value**]{style="color:#70AD47"} for Chi-squared test in R

    -   We will not discuss the test statistic's equation

5.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#70AD47"} to the hypothesis test

    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

## Chi-squared test: Expected Cell Counts

-   Is the sample size big enough for the chi-square test to be adequate? What are the expected cell counts?

¬†

-   If you want an explanation of how to calculate by hand, please see Vu and Harringtion TB (section 8.3.1, page 405)

¬†

-   Too time consuming for this class, but R does it quickly using the `expected()` function in the `epitools` package

## Chi-squared test: Expected Cell Counts

-   In the Strong Heart Study...

## Fisher's Exact Test

-   Only necessary when expected counts in one or more cells is less than 5
-   Given row and column totals fixed, computes exact probability that we observe our data or more extreme data
-   Consider a general 2 x 2 table:

![](./images/fisher_tab.png){fig-align="center"}

-   The exact probability of observing a table with cells (a, b, c, d) can be computed based on the hypergeometric distribution

$$P(a, b, c, d) = \dfrac{(a+b)!\cdot(c+d)!\cdot(a+c)!\cdot(b+d)!}{n!\cdot a!\cdot b!\cdot c!\cdot d!}$$

-   Numerator is fixed and denominator changes

## Fisher's Exact test: Process

1.  Check the [**expected cell counts**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

2.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#70AD47"} $\alpha$

3.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

    -   In symbols
    -   In words
    -   Alternative: one- or two-sided?

4.  Calculate the [**test statistic**]{style="color:#70AD47"} and [**p-value**]{style="color:#70AD47"} for Fisher Exact test in R

    -   We will not discuss the test statistic's equation

5.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#70AD47"} to the hypothesis test

    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

## Fisher's Exact test: SHS Example (not appropriate use of Fisher's Exact)

    -   $H_0$ : There is no association between glucose tolerance and diabetes
    -   $H_1$ : There is an association between glucose tolerance and diabetes

## Test of Trend

-   If [one or both variables are ordinal]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"}, a [test of trend]{style="color:#70AD47; font-style: italic;"} may be of interest

    -   Treats ordinal variables as quantitative rather than qualitative (nominal scale)
    -   Test of trend has greater power than the test of general association
    -   You can use a test of general association for non-ordinal variables

¬†

-   Two tests of trend that we we learn:

    -   **Cochran-Armitage test**

        -   Tests association between a *binary* response and an *ordinal* explanatory variable

    -   **Mantel-Haenszel test**

        -   Test association between an *ordinal* response and an *ordinal* explanatory variable

## Cochran-Armitage test

-   Cochran-Armitage test for trend will determine if there is association between a [binary response variable]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"} and an [ordinal variable with 3 or more categories]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"}

¬†

-   It will test the trend of the proportions over the ordinal variable

    -   Answers the question: Does the proportion of people with a "successful" outcome increase as the ordinal explanatory variable increases?
  
¬†

-   Cochran-Armitage test for trend is only suitable for 2 x C contingency tables

    -   We will not discuss the test statistic's equation
    -   Just know it follows a Normal distribution

4.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#70AD47"} to the hypothesis test

    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

## Cochran-Armitage test: Example (2/3)

-   Before we go into the hypothesis test procedure, we need to construct the contingency table in R

```{r}
Cancer = c(320, 1206, 1011, 463, 220)
No_Cancer = c(1422, 4432, 2893, 1092, 406)
bscancer = matrix (c(Cancer, No_Cancer), nrow = 2, byrow = T)
rownames(bscancer) = c("Cancer","No Cancer")
colnames(bscancer) = c("<20","20-24","25-29","30-34",">=35")
bscancer
```

-   It does not need to be pretty to use in function

## Cochran-Armitage test: Example (3/3)

::: columns
::: column
1.  $\alpha = 0.05$

2.  Hypothesis test:

    -   $H_0$: The proportions of breast cancer are the same for all age levels of first birth. $$p_1 = p_2 = ... = p_5$$
    -   $H_1$: The proportions of breast cancer tends to increase as level of age of first birth increases

$$p_1 \leq p_2 \leq ... \leq p_5$$
:::

::: column
3.  Calculate the test statistic and p-value for Cochran-Armitage test in R

4.  Conclusion to the hypothesis test

We reject the null hypothesis that proportions of breast cancer are the same for all age levels of first birth ($p<2.2\cdot10^{-16}$). There is sufficient evidence that the proportion of of breast cancer increase as the the age at first birth increases.

## Mantel-Haenszel test: Example (1/3)

A water treatment company is studying water additives and investigating how they affect clothes washing (through measurements of abrasions, wearing, and color loss). 

The treatments studies where no treatment (plain water), the standard treatment, and a double dose of the standard treatment, called super. Washability was measured as low, medium and high. 

Are levels of washability associated with treatment?
