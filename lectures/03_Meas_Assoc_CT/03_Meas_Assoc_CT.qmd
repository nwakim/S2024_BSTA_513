## Review of Test of Association (1/2)

-   Last week: learned some tests of association for contingency tables

 

-   For studies with two independent samples

    -   General association
        -   Chi-squared test
        -   Fisher’s Exact test
    -   Test of trends
        -   Cochran-Armitage test
        -   Mantel-Haenszel test

 

## Review of Test of Association (2/2)

![](./images/test_organization.png){fig-align="center"}


## Test of association does not measure association

-   Test of association does not provide an effective measure of association. The p-value alone is not enough

    -   $\text{p-value} < 0.05$ suggests there is a statistically significant association between the group and outcome

    -   $\text{p-value} = 0.00001$ vs. $\text{p-value} = 0.01$ does not mean the magnistude of association is different

 

-   But it does not tell how different the risks are between the two groups

 

-   We want to find out one or more measurements for quantifying the risks across the groups.

## Measures of Association

-   When we have a 2x2 contingency table and independent samples, we have an option of three measures of association:

     

    1.  Risk difference (RD)

     

    2.  Relative risk (RR)

     

    3.  Odds ratio (OR)

 

Each measures association by comparing the proportion of successes/failures from each categorical group of our explanatory variable.

## Before we discuss each further...

 

Let's define the cells within a 2x2 contingency table:

 

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](./images/ct.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
:::
:::

-   Then we can define risk: the proportion of "successes"

    -   With $\text{Risk}_1 = \dfrac{n_{11}}{n_1}$

3.  Estimate the risk ratio (and its confidence interval) from a contingency table and interpret the estimate.

4.  Estimate the odds ratio (and its confidence interval) from a contingency table and interpret the estimate.

## Risk Difference (RD)

-   Risk difference computes the absolute difference in risk for the two groups (from the explanatory variable)

-   Point estimate: $$\widehat{RD} = \widehat{p}_1 - \widehat{p}_1 = \dfrac{n_{11}}{n_1} - \dfrac{n_{21}}{n_2}$$

    -   With range of point estimate from $[-1, 1]$

-   Approximate standard error:

$$ SE_{\widehat{RD}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1\cdot(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2\cdot(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$$

-   95% Wald confidence interval for $\widehat{RD}$:

$$\widehat{RD} \pm 1.96 \cdot SE_{\widehat{RD}}$$

## Recall the Strong Heart Study

3.  Interpret the estimate

The diabetes diagnosis risk difference between impaired and normal glucose tolerance is 0.2591 (95% CI: 0.2141, 0.3041). Since the 95% confidence interval contains 0, we do not have sufficient evidence that the risk of diabetes diagnosis between impaired and normal glucose tolerance is different.

## When is the risk difference misleading?

-   The same risk differences can have very different clinical meanings depending on the risk for each group

 

 

-   **Example:** for two treatments A and B, we know the risk difference (RD) is 0.009. Is it a meaningful difference?

    -   If the risk is 0.01 for Trt A and 0.001 for Trt B?
    -   If the risk is 0.41 for Trt A and 0.401 for Trt B?

 

-   Using the RD alone to summarize the difference in risks for comparing the two groups can be **misleading**

    -   The **ratio of risk** can provide an informative descriptive measure of the "relative risk"

# Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the difference between testing for association and measuring association

2.  Estimate the risk difference (and its confidence interval) from a contingency table and interpret the estimate.

3.  Estimate the risk ratio (and its confidence interval) from a contingency table and interpret the estimate.

4.  Estimate the odds ratio (and its confidence interval) from a contingency table and interpret the estimate.

## Relative Risk (RR)

-   Relative risk computes the ratio of each group’s proportions of "success"

    -   Also called **risk ratio**    

-   Point estimate: $$\widehat{RR}=\dfrac{\hat{p}_1}{\hat{p}_2} = \dfrac{n_{11}/n_1}{n_{21}/n_2}$$

    -   Range: $[0, \infty]$

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

## Log-transformation of RR

-   Sampling distribution of the relative risk is highly skewed unless sample sizes are quite large

    -   Log transformation results in approximately normal distribution
    -   Thus, compute confidence interval using normally distributed, log-transformed RR
    -   Then we convert back to the RR

-   We take the log (natural log) of RR: $\ln(\widehat{RR})$ or $log(\widehat{RR})$

    -   Whenever I say "log" I mean natural log (very common in statistics)

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Then we need to find approximate standard error for $\ln(\widehat{RR})$ $$SE_{\ln(\widehat{RR})}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{11}}\ -\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_{21}}-\frac{1}{n_2}}$$

-   95% confidence interval for $\ln(\widehat{RR})$: $$\ln(\widehat{RR}) \pm 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{RR})}$$
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
 

![](./images/ct.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## How do we get back to the RR scale?

-   We computed confidence interval using normally distributed, log-transformed RR ($\ln(\widehat{RR})$):

$$ \bigg(\ln(\widehat{RR}) - 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{RR})}, \ \ln(\widehat{RR}) + 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{RR})}\bigg)$$

-   Now we need to exponentiate the CI to get back to interpretable values

    -   Take exponential of lower and upper bounds

-   95% confidence interval for RR: two ways to display equation

$$ \bigg(e^{\ln(\widehat{RR}) - 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{RR})}}, \ e^{\ln(\widehat{RR}) + 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{RR})}}\bigg)$$ $$ \bigg(\exp\big(\ln(\widehat{RR}) - 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{RR})}\big), \ \exp\big(\ln(\widehat{RR}) + 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{RR})}\big)\bigg)$$

## Relative Risk (RR)

-   Can you compute the estimated RRs for the previous example?

    -   If the risk for Trt A is 0.01 and Trt B is 0.001? $\widehat{RR}= 10$
    -   If the risk for Trt A is 0.41 and Trt B is 0.401? $\widehat{RR}= 1.02$

-   When $\widehat{RR}= 1$ ...

    -   Risk is the same for the two groups
    -   In other words, the group and the outcome are independent

-   When computing $\widehat{RR}$ it is important to identify which variable is the response variable and which is explanatory variable

    -   We may say "risk for Trt A" but this translates to the risk (or probability) of outcome success for those receiving Trt A

3.  Interpret the estimate

The estimated risk of diabetes is 3.29 times greater for American Indians who had impaired glucose tolerance at baseline compared to those who had normal glucose tolerance (95% CI: 2.70, 4.01).

 

Additional interpretation of 95% CI (not needed): We are 95% confident that the (population) relative risk is between 2.70 and 4.01.

 

Since the 95% confidence interval does not include 1, there is sufficient evidence that the risk of diabetes differs significantly between impaired and normal glucose tolerance at baseline.

## Odds (building up to Odds Ratio)

-   For a probability of success $p$ (or sometimes referred to as $\pi$), the odds of success is: $$\text{odds}=\frac{p}{1-p}=\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}$$

    -   **Example:** if $\pi=0.75$, then odds of success $= \dfrac{0.75}{0.25}=3$

-   If odds \> 1, it implies a success is more likely than a failure

    -   Example: for $odds = 3$, we expect to observe three times as many successes as failures

-   If odds is known, the probability of success can be computed $$\pi = \dfrac{\text{odds}}{\text{odds}+1}$$

## Odds Ratio (OR)

-   Odds ratio is the ratio of two odds:$$\widehat{OR}=\frac{odds_1}{odds_2}=\frac{{\hat{p}}_1/(1-{\hat{p}}_1)}{{\hat{p}}_2/(1-{\hat{p}}_2)}$$

    -   **Range:** $[0, \infty]$

    -   **Interpretation:** The odds of success for "group 1" is "$\widehat{OR}$" times the odds of success for "group 2"

 

-   What do values of odds ratios mean?

    +--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | Odds Ratio         | Clinical Meaning                                      |
    +====================+=======================================================+
    | $\widehat{OR} < 1$ | Odds of success is smaller in group 1 than in group 2 |
    +--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | $\widehat{OR} = 1$ | Explanatory and response variables are independent    |
    +--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | $\widehat{OR} > 1$ | Odds of success is greater in group 1 than in group 2 |
    +--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

## Poll Everywhere Question 3

## Odds Ratio (OR)

-   Values of OR farther from 1.0 in a given direction represent stronger association

    -   An OR = 4 is farther from independence than an OR = 2
    -   An OR = 0.25 is farther from independence than an OR = 0.5
    -   For OR = 4 and OR = 0.25, they are equally away from independence (because ¼ = 0.25)

 

-   We take the inverse of the OR for **success** of [group 1]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"} compared to [group 2]{style="color:#4472C4; font-weight: bold;"} to get...

    -   OR for **failure** of [group 1]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"} compared to [group 2]{style="color:#4472C4; font-weight: bold;"}
    -   OR for **success** of [group 2]{style="color:#4472C4; font-weight: bold;"} compared to [group 1]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"}

## Log-transformation of *OR*

-   Like RR, sampling distribution of the odds ratio is highly skewed

    -   Log transformation results in approximately normal distribution
    -   Thus, compute confidence interval using normally distributed, log-transformed OR

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Approximate standard error for $\ln (\widehat{OR})$: $$SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{11}}\ +\frac{1}{n_{12}}+\frac{1}{n_{21}}+\frac{1}{n_{22}}}$$

-   95% confidence interval for $\ln(\widehat{OR})$: $$\ln(\widehat{OR}) \pm 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})}$$
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
 

![](./images/ct.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

## How do we get back to the OR scale?

-   We computed confidence interval using normally distributed, log-transformed RR ($\ln(\widehat{OR})$):

$$ \bigg(\ln(\widehat{OR}) - 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})}, \ \ln(\widehat{OR}) + 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})}\bigg)$$

-   Now we need to exponentiate the CI to get back to interpretable values

    -   Take exponential of lower and upper bounds

-   95% confidence interval for RR: two ways to display equation

$$ \bigg(e^{\ln(\widehat{OR}) - 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})}}, \ e^{\ln(\widehat{OR}) + 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})}}\bigg)$$ $$ \bigg(\exp\big(\ln(\widehat{OR}) - 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})}\big), \ \exp\big(\ln(\widehat{OR}) + 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})}\big)\bigg)$$

$\widehat{p}_1 = 198/532 = `r round(p1, 4)`$, $\widehat{p}_2 = 128/1132 = `r round(p2, 4)`$ $$\widehat{OR}=\frac{\widehat{p_1}/(1-\widehat{p_1})}{\widehat{p_2}/(1-\widehat{p_2})}= \dfrac{`r round(p1, 4)`/(1-`r round(p1, 4)`)}{`r round(p2, 4)`/(1-`r round(p2, 4)`)}= `r round((p1/(1-p1))/(p2/(1-p2)), 4)`$$

$$\begin{aligned} & \ln(\widehat{OR}) \pm 1.96 \times SE_{\ln(\widehat{OR})} \\ 
= &\ln(\widehat{OR}) \pm z_{\left(1-\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)}^\ast \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_{11}}\ +\frac{1}{n_{12}}+\frac{1}{n_{21}}+\frac{1}{n_{22}}}\\ 
=  & `r round(log((p1/(1-p1))/(p2/(1-p2))), 4)` \pm 1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{1}{198}\ +\frac{1}{334}+\frac{1}{128}+\frac{1}{1004}}\\ 
=  & (`r round(log(3.605289), 4)`,\ `r round(log(5.997148), 4)` )\end{aligned}$$

3.  Interpret the estimate

The estimated odds of diabetes for American Indians with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline is 4.65 times the odds for American Indians with normal glucose tolerance at baseline.

 

Additional interpretation of 95% CI (not needed): We are 95% confident that the odds ratio is between 3.61 and 6.00.

 

Since the 95% confidence interval does not include 1, there is sufficient evidence that the odds of diabetes differs significantly between impaired and normal glucose tolerance at baseline.

## Inversing an Odds Ratio

-   Some clinicians may prefer interpretations of OR \> 1 instead of an OR \< 1

-   The transformation can easily be done by inverse

    -   Remember we discussed that OR = 4 is an equivalent a strong association as OR = 0.25 (1/4)

-   OR comparing [group 1]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"} to [group 2]{style="color:#4472C4; font-weight: bold;"} = inverse of OR comparing [group 2]{style="color:#4472C4; font-weight: bold;"} to [group 1]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"}

$$ OR_{1v2}=\frac{{\hat{p}}_1/(1-{\hat{p}}_1)}{{\hat{p}}_2/(1-{\hat{p}}_2)}=\frac{1}{\frac{{\hat{p}}_2/(1-{\hat{p}}_2)}{{\hat{p}}_1/(1-{\hat{p}}_1)}}=\frac{1}{OR_{2v1}}$$

**Needed steps:**

1.  Inverse point estimate and confidence interval

$$\widehat{OR}=\frac{1}{4.6499}=`r round(1/4.649888, 4)`$$ The 95% Confidence interval is then

$$ \left(\frac{1}{5.9971}, \frac{1}{3.6053}\right)\ =\ (`r round(1/5.997148, 4)`, `r round(1/3.605289, 4)`)$$

2.  Interpret the estimate

The estimated odds of diabetes for American Indians with normal glucose tolerance at baseline is 0.22 times the odds for American Indians with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline.

 

Additional interpretation of 95% CI (not needed): We are 95% confident that the odds ratio is between 0.17 and 0.28.

 

Since the 95% confidence interval does not include 1, there is sufficient evidence that the odds of diabetes differs significantly between impaired and normal glucose tolerance at baseline.

# Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the difference between testing for association and measuring association

2.  Estimate the risk difference (and its confidence interval) from a contingency table and interpret the estimate.

3.  Estimate the risk ratio (and its confidence interval) from a contingency table and interpret the estimate.

4.  Estimate the odds ratio (and its confidence interval) from a contingency table and interpret the estimate.

## `pubh` vs. `epitools`

-   In `pubh` with `contingency()`

    -   Get all the info at once
    -   Really nice to double check how the code is interpreting your input

-   In `epitools` with `riskratio()` or `oddsratio()`

    -   Much easier to grab the numbers! 
    -   [In Quarto you can take R code and directly put it in your text](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html#syntax-compatibility)
    
        ```{r}
        g = oddsratio(x = SHS_ct, method = "wald", rev = "rows")
        g$measure[2,1]
        ```
    
        -   I can write `{r eval="false" echo="true"} round(g$measure[2,1], 3)` to print the number `r round(g$measure[2,1], 3)`
