# Learning Objectives

1.  Use test statistics of goodness-of-fit to determine if our preliminary final model fits the data well

    -   Using Pearson residual statistic (𝑋\^2) \~ 𝜒\_(𝐽−(𝑝+1))\^2
    -   Using Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic (𝐶 ̂) \~ 𝜒\_(𝑔−2)\^2

2.  Apply ROC AUC to determine how well model predicts binary outcome

3.  Apply AIC and BIC as a summary measure to make additional comparisons between potential models

## Overview (NEED TO REVISIT!!)

-   Once the preliminary final model has been determined, we need to assess the fit of the model

-   Variable selection is no longer our focus at this stage

    -   We want to find answer to whether the model fits the data adequately

-   Assessing the Goodness of Fit or Assessing model fit

    -   Assess how well our fitted logistic regression model predicts/estimates the observed outcomes

    -   Comparison: fitted/estimated outcome vs. observed outcome

## Overview (NEED TO REVISIT!!)

-   The model building strategies we have discussed so far only assess the importance of covariates

    -   It did not assess model fit

-   Previous in model building, we made relative comparisons between models

    -   Our conclusions were limited to: Model 1 (full model) fits data better than Model 2 (reduced model)

-   Assessing goodness of fit is

    -   Not a relative comparison
    -   It is an absolute comparison
    -   To compare the fitted model to the largest possible model (saturated model)
    -   Model adequacy vs. Model comparison

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

## Components to Assess Model Fit

-   The model fits the data well if

    -   Summary measures of the distance between the predicted/estimated/fitted and observed Y are small

    -   The contribution of each pair (predicted and observed) to these summary measures is unsystematic and is small relative to the error structure of the model

    -   It is possible to see a “good” summary measure of the distance between predicted and observed Y with some substantial deviation from fit for a few subjects

## Components to Assess Model Fit

1.  Computation and evaluation of **overall measures of fit**

2.  Examination of other measures of the difference or **distance between the observed and fitted/predicted values**

3.  Examination of the **individual components** of the summary statistics (will do in Lesson 14: Model Diagnostics)

-   Today we focus on #1 and #2

## Summary Measures of Goodness of Fit

# Learning Objectives

## Comparing fitted outcome to observed outcome
