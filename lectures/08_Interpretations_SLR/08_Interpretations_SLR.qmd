# Learning Objectives

1.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a continuous explanatory variable.

2.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a binary explanatory variable.

3.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a multi-level categorical explanatory variable.

4.  Report the odds ratio using a table and/or a forest plot.

## So far we've looked at the association using the log-odds scale

::: columns

For a *population* simple logistic regression model with a continuous predictor $$\text{logit}(\pi(X)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X$$

-   $\beta_0$: log-odds when X is 0
-   $\beta_1$: increase in log-odds for every 1 unit increase in X

For our *fitted* simple logistic regression model with a continuous predictor $$\text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X)) = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot X$$

-   $\widehat{\beta}_0$: estimated log-odds of $Y=1$ when X is 0.
-   $\widehat{\beta}_1$: estimated increase in log-odds of $Y=1$ for every 1 unit increase in X
-   Can use expected instead of estimated

## Example: From last class

```{r}
bc_reg = glm(Late_stage_diag ~ Age_c, data = bc, family = binomial)
tidy(bc_reg, conf.int=T) %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>%
  fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

-   For our *fitted* simple logistic regression model with age as a predictor $$\text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(Age^c)) = −0.989  + 0.057     \cdot Age^c$$

-   $\widehat{\beta}_0$: The estimated log-odds is -0.989 when age is `r round(mean_age, 2)` years (95% CI: -1.035, -0.944)

-   $\widehat{\beta}_1$: The estimated increase in log-odds is 0.057 for every 1 year increase in age (95% CI: 0.051, 0.063).

## Poll Everywhere Question 1

## We typically interpret our results using odds ratios

For our *fitted* simple logistic regression model with a continuous predictor $$\text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X)) = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot X$$

-   How do we go from interpretations of $\widehat{\beta}_0$ and $\widehat{\beta}_1$ using log odds to odds ratios?

-   We will need to take the exponential of our model:

    -   $\text{exp}(\widehat{\beta}_0)$: expected odds that $Y=1$ when X is 0.
    -   $\text{exp}(\widehat{\beta}_1)$: expected odds ratio that $Y=1$ for every 1 unit increase in X

-   **Important distinction:**

    -   We take the **inverse logit** to find our **predicted probability**
    -   We take the **exponential** to interpret the **odds/odds ratios**

## Intro/Recap of Interpreting Fitted Model

-   Interpret coefficients from fitted logistic regression model

    -   **Goodness-of-fit of model should be assessed before summarizing findings** (have not covered yet)
    -   In this lecture: assume model fits data well

-   The interpretation of the coefficients involves two issues:

    -   The functional relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable (link function)
    -   Unit of change for the independent variable

-   We will learn the interpretation for

    -   Binary independent variable

    -   Categorical independent variable with multiple groups

        -   We looked at this for our race and ethnicity variable

    -   Continuous independent variable

:::

2.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a binary explanatory variable.

3.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a multi-level categorical explanatory variable.

4.  Report the odds ratio using a table and/or a forest plot.

## Coefficient interpretation: Continuous Independent Variable

-   For simplicity, we assume the linear relationship between logit and continuous variable 𝑥

-   Again using simple logistic regression model to illustrate the interpretation of $\widehat{\beta}$ for a continuous variable $x$ $$\text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X)) = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot X$$

-   The estimated slope coefficient, $\widehat{\beta}_1$, is the **expected change in the log odds for 1 unit increase in** $x$

    -   Additional attention should be paid to picking a meaningful units of change in $x$
    
## How do we get the odds ratio for X's coefficient?

::: columns
::: {.column width="42%"}
For $\text{exp}(\widehat{\beta}_1)$

-   We compare $X=x$ and $X=x+1$,
-   So we have $$\text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X = x)) = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot x$$ and $$\text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X = x+1)) = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot (x+1)$$
-   And... $$\begin{aligned} & \text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X = x+1)) - \text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X = x)) \\ & =  
    \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot (x+1) - \big[\widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot x \big] \\ &= \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot x + \widehat{\beta}_1 - \widehat{\beta}_0 - \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot x \\ & = 
    \widehat{\beta}_1 \end{aligned}$$
:::

::: {.column width="58%"}
-   Thus, $$\begin{aligned} \widehat{\beta}_1 & =  \text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X = x+1)) - \text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X = x)) \\
    \widehat{\beta}_1 & =  \text{log}\Bigg(\dfrac{\widehat{\pi}(X=x+1)}{1-\widehat{\pi}(X=x+1)}\Bigg) - \text{log}\Bigg(\dfrac{\widehat{\pi}(X=x)}{1-\widehat{\pi}(X=x)}\Bigg) \\ 
    \widehat{\beta}_1 & =  \text{log}\left(\dfrac{\dfrac{\widehat{\pi}(X=x+1)}{1-\widehat{\pi}(X=x+1)}} {\dfrac{\widehat{\pi}(X=x)}{1-\widehat{\pi}(X=x)}}\right) \\ 
    \text{exp}\big[\widehat{\beta}_1\big] & =  \text{exp}\left[\text{log}\left(\dfrac{\text{odds}_{X=x+1}} {\text{odds}_{X=x}}\right) \right] \\ 
    \text{exp}\big[\widehat{\beta}_1\big] & =  \dfrac{\text{odds}_{X=x+1}} {\text{odds}_{X=x}} \\ 
    \end{aligned}$$
:::
:::

## Example: Interpretation of Age Coefficient/OR

-   $\widehat{\beta}_1$ is 0.057, suggesting that one year increase in age is associated with 0.057 increase in log odds of receiving a late stage breast cancer diagnosis

-   $\exp\left({\widehat{\beta}}_1\right)$ is 1.06, suggesting that one year increase in age is associated with 1.06 times the odds of receiving a late stage breast cancer diagnosis

-   For continuous covariates in logistic regression model, it is helpful to subtract 1 from the odds ratio and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage change in odds for 1-unit increase.

    -   The estimated OR for age is 1.06, suggesting that a 1-year increase in age is associated with a 6% increase in the predicted odds of late stage diagnosis in the patient population

:::

::: ex-cont

3.  Interpret the odds ratio

For every one year increase in age, there is an estimated `r round(100*(tidy_bc_reg$estimate[2]-1), 2)`% increase in the estimated odds of late stage breast cancer diagnosis (95% CI: `r round(100*(tidy_bc_reg$conf.low[2]-1), 2)`%, `r round(100*(tidy_bc_reg$conf.high[2]-1),2)`%).

## Transformations of continuous variable to make more interpretable

-   Sometimes a change in “1” unit may not be considered clinically interesting

    -   For example, a 1 year increase in age or a 1 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure may be too small for a meaningful change in log odds

    -   Instead, we may be interested to find out the log odds change for a increase of 10 years in age or 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure

    -   On the other hand, if the range of x is small (say 0-1), than a change in 1 unit of 𝑥 is too large to be meaningful

-   We should be able to compute and interpret coefficients for a continuous independent covariate $x$ for an arbitrary change of “c” units in $x$

## Transformations of continuous variable to make more interpretable

-   The estimated log odds ratio for a change of c units in x can be obtained from $$\hat{g}\left(x+c\right)-\hat{g}\left(x\right)=c{\hat{\beta}}_1$$

    -   $\widehat{OR}\left(c\right)=\exp\left(c{\hat{\beta}}_1\right)$

-   The 95% CI for $\widehat{OR}(c)$ is: $$\exp \left( c \hat{\beta}_1 \pm 1.96 \cdot c \cdot SE_{\hat{\beta}_1} \right)$$

-   The $c$ is chosen to be a clinically meaningful unit change in $x$

-   The value of 𝑐 should be clearly specified in all tables and calculations

    -   Because the estimated OR and the corresponding CI depends on the choice of 𝑐 value

## Example: 10 year increase in age and Late Stage Diagnosis

-   What if we are interested in learning the OR corresponding to 10-year increase in age?

```{r}
bc_reg = glm(Late_stage_diag ~ Age_c, data = bc, family = binomial)
tidy(bc_reg, conf.int=T) %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>%
  fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

## Example: 10 year increase in age and Late Stage Diagnosis

-   What if we are interested in learning the OR corresponding to 10-year increase in age?

$$ \widehat{OR}\left(10\right)=\exp{\left(10\cdot{\hat{\beta}}_1\right)}=\exp{\left(0.56965\right)}=\mathrm{\mathrm{1.767}}$$

-   The 95% CI for $\widehat{OR}\left(10\right)$ is: $$\begin{aligned} \widehat{OR}\left(10\right) &=\exp{\left(10\cdot{\hat{\beta}}_1\pm1.96\cdot10\cdot SE_{\hat{\beta}_1} \right)} \\ &=\exp{\left(10\cdot0.056965\pm1.96\cdot10\cdot0.003204\right)}\\
    &=(1.66,\ 1.88) \end{aligned}$$

## Example: 10 year increase in age and Late Stage Diagnosis

-   What if we are interested in learning the OR corresponding to 10-year increase in age?

```{r}
bc2 = bc %>% mutate(Age_c_10 = Age_c/10)
bc_reg_10 = glm(Late_stage_diag ~ Age_c_10, data = bc2, family = binomial)
tidy(bc_reg_10, conf.int=T, exponentiate = T) %>% gt() %>% tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>%
  fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

## Last Note About Continuous Independent Variable

-   Notice that the logistic regression model suggests that logit is linear in the covariate

-   The model implies the additional risk of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for a 40 year-old compared to a 30 year-old is the same as the additional risk of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for a 60 year-old compared to a 50-year-old

-   This assumption may not be realistic

-   To address this, we may consider using higher order terms (e.g., $x^2$, $x^3$,…) or other nonlinear transformation(e.g., $log(x)$)

-   Categorize the continuous variable may be another option

## How do we get the odds for the intercept?

For $\text{exp}(\widehat{\beta}_0)$

-   When $X=0$, we have $$\text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X=0)) = \widehat{\beta}_0$$

-   Thus, $$\begin{aligned} \widehat{\beta}_0 & = \text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X)) \\
    \text{exp}\big[\widehat{\beta}_0\big] & = \text{exp}\big[\text{logit}(\widehat{\pi}(X))\big] \\ 
    \text{exp}\big[\widehat{\beta}_0\big] & = \text{exp}\Bigg[\text{log}\Bigg(\dfrac{\widehat{\pi}(X)}{1-\widehat{\pi}(X)}\Bigg)\Bigg] \\ 
    \text{exp}\big[\widehat{\beta}_0\big] & = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}(X)}{1-\widehat{\pi}(X)} \\ 
    \end{aligned}$$

3.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a multi-level categorical explanatory variable.

4.  Report the odds ratio using a table and/or a forest plot.

## Coefficient Interpretation: Binary Independent Variable

-   Independent variable $x$ is a binary variable ($x$ can take values: 0 or 1)

-   We are fitting the simple logistic regression model: $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X) \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(X=1)$$

-   The logit difference is $\beta_1$ for binary independent variable

    -   $\beta_1$ represents the change/difference in the logit for $x=1$ vs. $x=0$

-   It will be much easier to understand if we can interpret the coefficient using odds ratio (OR)

## Binary: How do we interpret the coefficient? (I)

-   For individuals with $X=0$: $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X=0)\right)=\beta_0+\beta_1\times\left(0\right)=\beta_0$$

-   For individuals with $X=1$: $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X=1)\right)=\beta_0+\beta_1\times\left(1\right)=\beta_0 + \beta_1$$

-   To solve for $\beta_1$, we take the difference of the logits: $$ \text{logit}\left(\pi(X=1)\right) - \text{logit}\left(\pi(X=0)\right) = \left( \beta_0 + \beta_1 \right) - \left( \beta_0 \right) = \beta_1$$

## Binary: How do we interpret the coefficient? (II)

$$ \text{logit}\left(\pi(X=1)\right) - \text{logit}\left(\pi(X=0)\right) = \left( \beta_0 + \beta_1 \right) - \left( \beta_0 \right) = \beta_1$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_1&=l\mathrm{ogit}\left(\pi(X=1)\right)\ -l\mathrm{ogit}\left(\pi\left(X=0\right)\right) \\  \beta_1&=l\mathrm{og}\left(\dfrac{\pi(X=1)}{1-\pi(X=1)}\right)-l\mathrm{og}\left(\dfrac{\pi\left(X=0\right)}{1-\pi\left(X=0\right)}\right) \\ 
\beta_1&=\log{\left(\dfrac{\dfrac{\pi(X=1)}{1-\pi(X=1)}}{\dfrac{\pi(X=0)}{1-\pi(X=0)}}\right)} \\ \exp{\left(\beta_1\right)}&=\dfrac{\dfrac{\pi(X=1)}{1-\pi(X=1)}}{\dfrac{\pi(X=0)}{1-\pi(X=0)}}
\end{aligned}$$

## Review of Odds Ratio

-   Odds for a subject with $X=1$: $$\text{odds}_1 = \dfrac{\pi(X=1)}{1-\pi(X=1)}$$

-   Odds for a subject with $X=0$: $$\text{odds}_0 = \dfrac{\pi(X=0)}{1-\pi(X=0)}$$

-   Odds Ratio for $X=1$ vs. $X=0$: $$OR = \dfrac{\dfrac{\pi(X=1)}{1-\pi(X=1)}}{\dfrac{\pi(X=0)}{1-\pi(X=0)}}$$

## How does this relate to a 2x2 table?

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

## How does this relate to a 2x2 table?

$$ 
OR=\dfrac{a/c}{b/d}=\dfrac{\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{\exp{\left(\beta_0+\beta_1\right)}}{1+\exp{\left(\beta_0+\beta_1\right)}}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{1}{1+\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1)}\right)}}{\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{\exp(\beta_0)}{1+\exp(\beta_0)}\right)}{\left(\dfrac{1}{1+\exp{\left(\beta_0\right)}}\right)}}=\dfrac{\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1)}{\exp(\beta_0)}=e^{\beta_1}
$$

-   Simple relationship between coefficient and odds ratio is a primary reason why we report OR for categorical data analysis.

-   For binary independent variable x, [OR computed in logistic regression]{style="color:#70AD47; font-weight: bold;"} model is the **same as** [OR computed using contingency table]{style="color:#4472C4; font-weight: bold;"}

## Example: Binary age and Late Stage Diagnosis (I)

-   Two options to calculate this value:

    -   [Option 1:]{style="color:#ED7D31; font-weight: bold;"} Calculate $\widehat{OR}$ from 2x2 contingency table

        -   Refer to [Lesson 3](https://nwakim.github.io/S2024_BSTA_513/lectures/03_Meas_Assoc_CT/03_Meas_Assoc_CT.html#/title-slide) for this process

    -   [Option 2:]{style="color:#D6295E; font-weight: bold;"} Calculate $\widehat{OR}$ from logistic regression

**Needed steps for [Option 2]{style="color:#D6295E; font-weight: bold;"}:**

The estimated odds of late stage breast cancer among individuals over 65 years old is `r round(age_bin_tidy$estimate[2], 2)` (95% CI: (`r round(age_bin_tidy$conf.low[2], 2)`, `r round(age_bin_tidy$conf.high[2], 2)`)) times that of individuals 65 years or younger.

## Coefficient Interpretation: Multi-group Categorical Variable

-   Independent variable $x$ is a multi-level categorical variable

-   Let's say $X$ takes values: a, b, c, or d

-   We are fitting the simple logistic regression model: $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X) \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(X=b) + \beta_2 \cdot I(X=c) + \beta_3 \cdot I(X=d)$$

    -   Where $a$ is our reference group

-   The logit difference is $\beta_1$ for binary independent variable

    -   $\beta_1$ represents the change/difference in the logit for $x=b$ vs. $x=a$

-   It will be much easier to understand if we can interpret the coefficient using odds ratio (OR)

## Coefficient Interpretation: Multi-group Categorical Variable

We are fitting the simple logistic regression model with reference group $a$: $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X) \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(X=b) + \beta_2 \cdot I(X=c) + \beta_3 \cdot I(X=d)$$

-   $\beta_0$: the log-odds of event $Y=1$ for group $a$
-   $\beta_1$: the difference in log-odds of event $Y=1$ comparing group $b$ to group $a$
-   $\beta_2$: the difference in log-odds of event $Y=1$ comparing group $c$ to group $a$
-   $\beta_3$: the difference in log-odds of event $Y=1$ comparing group $d$ to group $a$

## Multi-level categorical: How do we interpret the coefficient? (II)

$$ \text{logit}\left(\pi(X=c)\right) - \text{logit}\left(\pi(X=a)\right) = \left( \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot 0 + \beta_2\cdot 1 + \beta_3\cdot 0  \right) - \left( \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot 0 + \beta_2\cdot 0 + \beta_3\cdot 0 \right) = \beta_2$$

$$\begin{aligned}
\beta_2&=l\mathrm{ogit}\left(\pi(X=c)\right)\ -l\mathrm{ogit}\left(\pi\left(X=a\right)\right) \\  \beta_2&=l\mathrm{og}\left(\dfrac{\pi(X=c)}{1-\pi(X=c)}\right)-l\mathrm{og}\left(\dfrac{\pi\left(X=a\right)}{1-\pi\left(X=a\right)}\right) \\ 
\beta_2&=\log{\left(\dfrac{\dfrac{\pi(X=c)}{1-\pi(X=c)}}{\dfrac{\pi(X=a)}{1-\pi(X=a)}}\right)} \\ \exp{\left(\beta_2\right)}&=\dfrac{\dfrac{\pi(X=c)}{1-\pi(X=c)}}{\dfrac{\pi(X=a)}{1-\pi(X=a)}}
\end{aligned}$$

## Coefficient Interpretation: Multi-group Categorical Variable

We are fitting the simple logistic regression model with reference group $a$: $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X) \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(X=b) + \beta_2 \cdot I(X=c) + \beta_3 \cdot I(X=d)$$

-   $\exp\left(\beta_0\right)$: the odds of event $Y=1$ for group $a$
-   $\exp\left(\beta_1\right)$: the odds of event $Y=1$ for group $b$ is $\exp\left(\beta_1\right)$ times the odds of event $Y=1$ for group $a$
-   $\exp\left(\beta_2\right)$: the odds of event $Y=1$ for group $c$ is $\exp\left(\beta_2\right)$ times the odds of event $Y=1$ for group $a$
-   $\exp\left(\beta_3\right)$: the odds of event $Y=1$ for group $d$ is $\exp\left(\beta_3\right)$ times the odds of event $Y=1$ for group $a$

## How do we pick the reference group?

-   The choice can be more apparent for multi-group categorical independent variables within studies

-   For example, if we want to evaluate the association between clinical response and four treatments.

    -   The treatment variable has 4 categories: “active treatment A”, “active treatment B”, “active treatment C” and “Placebo treatment”

    -   The investigator is interested in comparing each of the three active treatment with the placebo treatment

    -   Then the placebo treatment should be picked as the reference group

## Example: Late stage diagnosis and race and ethnicity

**Needed steps:**

1.  Fit the regression model
2.  Transform the coefficients into odds ratios
3.  Interpret the odds ratio

::: ex-cont
What is the odds ratio of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander individuals compared to Non-Hispanic White individuals?
:::

1.  Fit the regression model

```{r}
RE_glm = glm(Late_stage_diag ~ Race_Ethnicity, data = bc,  
               family = binomial)
```


## Example: Late stage diagnosis and race and ethnicity

::: ex-title
Odds ratio from logistic regression
:::

::: ex-cont
What is the odds ratio of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander individuals compared to Non-Hispanic White individuals?
:::
:::

2.  Transform the coefficients into odds ratios

```{r}
RE_tidy = tidy(RE_glm, conf.int=T, exponentiate = T) 
RE_tidy %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 35) %>%
  fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

:::

::: ex-cont
What is the odds ratio of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander individuals compared to Non-Hispanic White individuals?
:::
:::

3.  Interpret the odds ratio

The estimated odds of late stage breast cancer among Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander individuals is `r round(RE_tidy$estimate[4], 2)` (95% CI: (`r round(RE_tidy$conf.low[4], 2)`, `r round(RE_tidy$conf.high[4], 2)`)) times that of Non-Hispanic White individuals.

## What if you want to compare other groups?

-   What if we want to estimate OR comparing Non-Hispanic Asian Pacific Islander to Non-Hispanic Black individuals?

-  [Option 1:]{style="color:#ED7D31; font-weight: bold;"} Change reference group and refit the model (maybe the easiest option)

-   [Option 2:]{style="color:#D6295E; font-weight: bold;"} Estimate OR using fitted coefficients ($\widehat{\beta}$'s) in the current model: $$\begin{aligned} \text{log}\left( OR (\text{NH API}, \text{NH B}) \right) &= \text{logit}\left(\pi \left(X = \text{NH API}\right)\right) - \text{logit}\left(\pi \left(X = \text{NH B}\right)\right) \\
& = \left[\beta_0 + \beta_3 \cdot 1\right] - \left[\beta_0 + \beta_4 \cdot 1 \right] \\
\text{log}\left( \widehat{OR} (\text{NH API}, \text{NH B}) \right) &= \widehat{\beta}_3 - \widehat{\beta}_4 \\ 
\widehat{OR} (\text{NH API}, \text{NH B}) &= \exp \left( \widehat{\beta}_3 - \widehat{\beta}_4 \right)
\end{aligned}$$

## Poll Everywhere Question 5

## What if you want to compare other groups? [Option 1]{style="color:#ED7D31; font-weight: bold;"}

```{r}
bc3 = bc %>% 
  mutate(Race_Ethnicity = relevel(Race_Ethnicity, ref = "NH Black"))
RE_glm2 = glm(Late_stage_diag ~ Race_Ethnicity, data = bc3, 
               family = binomial)
tidy(RE_glm2, conf.int=T, exponentiate = T) %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 38) %>%
  fmt_number(decimals = 3)
```

# Learning Objectives

1.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a continuous explanatory variable.

2.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a binary explanatory variable.

3.  Interpret odds ratios from fitted simple logistic regression model for a multi-level categorical explanatory variable.

::: lob
4.  Report the odds ratio using a table and/or a forest plot.

## How to present odds ratios: Table

-   `tbl_regression()` in the `gtsummary` package is helpful for presenting the odds ratios in a clean way

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
tbl_regression(RE_glm, exponentiate = TRUE) %>% 
  as_gt() %>% # allows us to use tab_options()
  tab_options(table.font.size = 38)
```


## How to present odds ratios: Forest Plot Setup

```{r}
library(broom.helpers)
RE_tidy = tidy_and_attach(RE_glm, conf.int=T, exponentiate = T) %>%
  tidy_remove_intercept() %>%
  tidy_add_reference_rows() %>% tidy_add_estimate_to_reference_rows() %>%
  tidy_add_term_labels()
glimpse(RE_tidy)
```

## How to present odds ratios: Forest Plot

```{r} 
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 15
#| fig-height: 8

ggplot(data=RE_tidy, aes(y=label, x=estimate, xmin=conf.low, xmax=conf.high)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +  geom_errorbarh(height=.2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=1, color='#C2352F', linetype='dashed', alpha=1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "OR (95% CI)", y = "Race and ethnicity", 
       title = "Odds ratios of Late Stage \n Breast Cancer Diagnosis") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 25), axis.text = element_text(size = 25), title = element_text(size = 25))
```
