## Last class

-   Looked at **simple logistic regression** for binary outcome with

    -   One continuous predictor $$\text{logit}(\pi(X)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X$$
    -   One binary predictor $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X) \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(X=1)$$
    -   One multi-level predictor $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X) \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(X=b) + \beta_2 \cdot I(X=c) + \beta_3 \cdot I(X=d)$$

## Breast Cancer example

-   For breast cancer diagnosis example, recall:

    -   **Outcome:** early or late stage breast cancer diagnosis (binary, categorical)
    
 

-   **Primary covariate:** Race/ethnicity

    -   Non-Hispanic white individuals are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer
    
        -   But POC are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage

 

-   **Additional covariate:** Age

    -   Risk factor for cancer diagnosis
    
 

-   We want to fit a multiple logistic regression model with both risk factors included as independent variables

## Introduction to Multiple Logistic Regression

-   In multiple logistic regression model, we have > 1 independent variable

    -   Sometimes referred to as the “multi**variable** regression”
    -   The independent variable can be any type: 

        -   Continuous
        -   Categorical (ordinal or nominal)

 

-   We will follow similar procedures as we did for simple logistic regression

    -   But we need to **change our interpretation of estimates** because we are adjusting for other variables


## Multiple Logistic Regression Model

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Assume we have a collection of $k$ independent variables, denoted by $\mathbf{X}=\left( X_1, X_2, ..., X_k \right)$

 

-   The conditional probability is $P(Y=1 | \mathbf{X}) = \pi(\mathbf{X})$


 

-   We then model the probability with logistic regression: $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(\mathbf{X})\right) = \beta_0
+\beta_1 \cdot X_1 +\beta_2 \cdot X_2  +\beta_3 \cdot X_3 + ... + \beta_k \cdot X_k$$
:::

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Why the bold $X$?
:::
::: thm-cont
$\mathbf{X}$ represents the vector of all the $X$'s. This is how we represent our group of covariates in our model.
:::

## Fitting the Multiple Logistic Regression Model
-   For a multiple logistic regression model with $k$ independent variables, the **vector of coefficients** can be denoted by $$\boldsymbol{\beta}^{T} = \left(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_k \right)$$

 

-   As with the simple logistic regression, we use **maximum likelihood method** for estimating coefficients

    -   Vector of estimated coefficients: $$\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{T} = \left(\widehat{\beta}_0, \widehat{\beta}_1, \widehat{\beta}_2, ..., \widehat{\beta}_k \right)$$

 

-   For a model with $k$ independent variables, there is $k+1$ coefficients to estimate

    -   Unless one of those independent variables is a multi-level categorical variables, then we need more than $k+1$ coefficients


## Breast Cancer Example: Population Model

-   We can fit a logistic regression model with both race and ethnicity and age:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\pi(\mathbf{X})\right) = & \beta_0
+\beta_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
+\beta_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +\beta_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+\beta_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+\beta_5 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

 

 

-   Note that race and ethnicity requires 4 coefficients to include the indicator for each category

 

-   Can replace $\pi(\mathbf{X})$ with $\pi({\text{Race/ethnicity, Age}})$

 

-   6 total coefficients ($\beta_0$ to $\beta_5$)

## Fitting Multiple Logistic Regression Model {.smaller}

```{r}
multi_bc = glm(Late_stage_diag ~ Race_Ethnicity + Age_c, data = bc, family = binomial)
summary(multi_bc)
```

## Breast Cancer Example: Fitted Model

-   We now have the **fitted logistic regression model** with both race and ethnicity and age:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\widehat{\pi}(\mathbf{X})\right) = & \widehat{\beta}_0
+ \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
+ \widehat{\beta}_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& + \widehat{\beta}_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+ \widehat{\beta}_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+ \widehat{\beta}_5 \cdot Age \\
\\
\text{logit}\left(\widehat{\pi}(\mathbf{X})\right) = &-4.56
-0.02 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
-0.09 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +0.13 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+0.36 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+0.06 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

-   6 total coefficients ($\widehat{\beta}_0$ to $\widehat{\beta}_5$)

## Testing Significance of the Coefficients

-   Refer to Lesson 6 for more information on each test!!

 

-   We use the same three tests that we discussed in Simple Logistic Regression to test individual coefficients

    -   [Wald test]{style="background-color:#D5E2F1;"}
    
        -   Can be used to test a single coefficient
        
    -   [~~Score test~~]{style="background-color:#F9E7B8;"}
    -   [Likelihood ratio test (LRT)]{style="background-color:#CADFB8;"}
    
        -   Can be used to test a single coefficient or multiple coefficients
        
 

-   Textbook and our class focuses on Wald and LRT only

## A note on wording

-   When I say "test a single coefficient" or "test multiple coefficients" I am referring to the $\beta$'s

    -   A single variable can have a single coefficient
        -   Example: testing age 
        
        
    -   A single variable can have multiple coefficients
        -   Example: testing race and ethnicity
        

    -   Muliple variables will have multiple coefficients
        -   Example: testing age and race and ethnicity together
    
     
       
-   When I say "test a variable" I mean "determine if the model with the variable is more likely than the model without that variable"

    -   We can use the Wald test to do this is some scenarios (single, continuous covariate)
    -   BUT I advise you practice using the LRT whenever comparing models (aka testing variables)

## All three tests together

![](./images/three_tests.png){fig-align="center"}

## From Lesson 6: Wald test{background-image="./images/title_blue.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   Assumes test statistic W follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis

-   Test statistic: $$W=\frac{{\hat{\beta}}_j}{SE_{\hat{\beta}_j}}\sim N(0,1)$$

    -   where $\widehat{\beta}_j$ is a MLE of coefficient $j$

-   95% Wald confidence interval: $${\hat{\beta}}_1\pm1.96 \cdot SE_{{\hat{\beta}}_j}$$

-   The Wald test is a routine output in R (`summary()` of `glm()` output)

    -   Includes $SE_{{\hat{\beta}}_j}$ and can easily find confidence interval with `tidy()`
    
-   **Important note:** Wald test is best for confidence intervals of our coefficient estimates or estimated odds ratios. 

    
## Wald test procedure with confidence intervals {background-image="./images/title_blue.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

1.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} $\alpha$

2.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"}

    -   In symbols
    -   In words
    -   Alternative: one- or two-sided?

3.  Calculate the [**confidence interval**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} and [**determine if it overlaps with null**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"}

    -   Overlap with null (usually 0 for coefficient) = fail to reject null
    -   No overlap with null (usually 0 for coefficient) = reject null

4.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} to the hypothesis test

    -   What is the estimate and its confidence interval?
    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem
    
## Wald test in our example {background-image="./images/title_blue.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   From our multiple logistic regression model:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\pi(x_i)\right) = & \beta_0
+\beta_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
+\beta_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +\beta_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+\beta_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+\beta_5 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

 

-   Wald test can help us **construct the confidence interval for ALL coefficient estimates**

 

-   If we want to use the Wald test to determine if a covariate is significant in our model

    -   Can only do so for **age**

## Likelihood ratio test {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   Likelihood ratio test answers the question:

    -   For a specific covariate, **which model tell us more about the outcome variable**: the model including the covariate (or set of covariates) or the model omitting the covariate (or set of covariates)?
    -   Aka: Which model is more likely given our data: model including the covariate or the model omitting the covariate?

 

-   Test a single coefficient by comparing different models

    -   **Very similar to the F-test**

 

-   Important: LRT can be used conduct hypothesis tests for **multiple coefficients**

    -   Just like F-test, we can test a single coefficient, continuous/binary covariate, multi-level covariate, or multiple covariates

## Likelihood ratio test (3/3) {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   If testing **single variable** and it’s **continuous or binary**, still use this hypothesis test:
	
    -   $H_0$: $\beta_j = 0$
    -   $H_1$: $\beta_j \neq 0$

 

-   If testing **single variable** and it’s **categorical with mroe than 2 groups**, use this hypothesis test:
    
    -   $H_0$: $\beta_j=\beta_{j+1}=\ldots=\beta_{j+i-1}=0$
    -   $H_1$: at least one of the above $\beta$’s is not equal to 0


 

-   If testing a **set of variables**, use this hypothesis test:

    -   $H_0$: $\beta_1=\beta_{2}=\ldots=\beta_{k}=0$
    -   $H_1$: at least one of the above $\beta$’s is not equal to 0

## LRT procedure {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

1.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#70AD47"} $\alpha$

2.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

    -   In symbols
    -   In words
    -   Alternative: one- or two-sided?

3.  Calculate the [**test statistic**]{style="color:#70AD47"} and [**p-value**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

4.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#70AD47"} to the hypothesis test

    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

## Likelihood ratio test (3/3) {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   From our multiple logistic regression model:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\pi(\mathbf{X})\right) = & \beta_0
+\beta_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
+\beta_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +\beta_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+\beta_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+\beta_5 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

-   We can test a single coefficient or multiple coefficients

     

    -   **Example 1:** Single, continuous variable: Age
    
     
    
    -   **Example 2:** Single, >2 categorical variable: Race and Ethnicity
    
     

    -   **Example 3:** Set of variables: Race and Ethnicity, and Age

## Reminder on nested models

-   Likelihood ratio test is only suitable to test “nested” models

-   “Nested” models means the bigger model (full model) contains all the independent variables of the smaller model (reduced model)

-   We cannot compare the following two models using LRT:

    -   Model 1: $$ \begin{aligned} \text{logit}\left(\pi(\mathbf{X})\right) = & \beta_0 +\beta_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right) +\beta_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\ & +\beta_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right) +\beta_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right) \end{aligned}$$

    -   Model 2: $$\begin{aligned} \text{logit}\left(\pi(Age)\right) = & \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot Age  \end{aligned}$$

-   If the two models to be compared are not nested, likelihood ratio test should not be used

## Estimated/Predicted Probability for MLR

-   Basic idea for predicting/estimating probability stays the same

 

-   Calculations will be slightly different

    -   Especially for the confidence interval
    
 

-   Recall our fitted model for late stage breast cancer diagnosis: $$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\widehat{\pi}(\mathbf{X})\right) = &-4.56
-0.02 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
-0.09 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +0.13 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+0.36 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+0.06 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

## Predicted Probability

-   We may be interested in predicting probability of having a late stage breast cancer diagnosis for a specific age.
-   The predicted probability is the estimated probability of having the event for given values of covariate(s)
-   Recall our fitted model for late stage breast cancer diagnosis: $$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\widehat{\pi}(\mathbf{X})\right) = &-4.56
-0.02 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
-0.09 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +0.13 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+0.36 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+0.06 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

-   We can convert it to the predicted probability: $$\hat{\pi}(\mathbf{X})=\dfrac{\exp \left( \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right) + ... + \widehat{\beta}_5 \cdot Age \right)}  {1+\exp \left(\widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right) + ... + \widehat{\beta}_5 \cdot Age \right)}$$

    -   This is an inverse logit calculation

-   We can calculate this using the the `predict()` function like in BSTA 512

    - Another option: taking inverse logit of fitted values from `augment()` function

1. Calculate probability prediction

```{r}
newdata = data.frame(Age_c = 60 - mean_age, 
                     Race_Ethnicity = "NH Asian/Pacific Islander")
pred1 = predict(multi_bc, newdata, se.fit = T, type="response")

2. Check if we can use Normal approximation

We can use the Normal approximation if: $\widehat{p}n = \widehat{\pi}(X)\cdot n > 10$ and $(1-\widehat{p})n = (1-\widehat{\pi}(X))\cdot n > 10$.

```{r}
n = nobs(multi_bc)
p = pred1$fit
n*p
n*(1-p)
```

We can use the Normal approximation!

3b. Calculate confidence interval (Option 2: with Normal approximation)

```{r}
pred = predict(multi_bc, newdata, se.fit = T, type = "response")

LL_CI = pred$fit - qnorm(1-0.05/2) * pred$se.fit
UL_CI = pred$fit + qnorm(1-0.05/2) * pred$se.fit

c(Pred = pred$fit, LL_CI, UL_CI) %>% round(digits=3)
```

  as_gt() %>% # allows us to use tab_options()
  tab_options(table.font.size = 38)
```

## Multivariable Logistic Regression Model

-   The multivariable model of logistic regression (called multiple logistic regression) is useful in that it statistically adjusts the estimated effect of each variable in the model

 

-   Each estimated coefficient provides an estimate of the log odds *adjusting for all other variables included in the model*

     
    
    -   The **adjusted odds ratio** can be different from or similar to the unadjusted odds ratio
    
     
    
    -   Comparing adjusted vs. unadjusted odds ratios can be a useful activity 

## Interpretation of Coefficients in MLR

-   The interpretation of coefficients in multiple logistic regression is *essentially the same as the interpretation of coefficients in simple logistic regression*

 

-   For interpretation, we need to 

    -   point out that these are adjusted estimates
    -   provide a list of other variables in the model

## Example: Race and Ethnicity and Age model fit (FIXED)

-   The estimated odds of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for Hispanic-Latinx individuals is 0.98 times that of Non-Hispanic White individuals, controlling for age (95% CI: 0.83, 1.16).

-   The estimated odds of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Natives is 0.92 times that of Non-Hispanic White individuals, controlling for age (95% CI: 0.33, 2.25).

-   The estimated odds of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders is 1.14 times that of Non-Hispanic White individuals, controlling for age (95% CI: 0.97, 1.35).

-   The estimated odds of late stage breast cancer diagnosis for Non-Hispanic Black individuals is 1.43 times that of Non-Hispanic White individuals, controlling for age (95% CI: 1.24, 1.65).

-   For every one year increase in age, there is an 6% increase in the estimated odds of late stage breast cancer diagnosis, adjusting for race and ethnicity (95% CI: 5%, 7%).
