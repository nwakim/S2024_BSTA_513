# Learning Objectives

1.  Construct and fit a multiple logistic regression model

2.  Test for significance of individual coefficients or sets of coefficients

3.  Estimate the predicted probability of our outcome

4.  Present the odds ratios

5.  Interpret odds ratios for coefficients while adjusting for other variables

## Last class

-   Looked at simple logistic regression for binary outcome with

    -   One continuous predictor $$\text{logit}(\pi(X)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X$$
    -   One binary predictor $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X) \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(X=1)$$
    -   One multi-level predictor $$\text{logit}\left(\pi(X) \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(X=b) + \beta_2 \cdot I(X=c) + \beta_3 \cdot I(X=d)$$

## Breast Cancer example

-   For breast cancer diagnosis example, recall:

    -   Outcome: early or late stage breast cancer diagnosis

-   Primary Covariate: Race/ethnicity

    -   While non-Hispanic white individuals are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, non-Hispanic black individuals have the highest death rate
    -   Racism affecting health care quality

-   Additional covariate: Age

    -   Also a risk factor for cancer diagnosis

-   We want to fit a multiple logistic regression model with both risk factors included as dependent variables

# Learning Objectives

## Introduction to Multiple Logistic Regression

## Multiple Logistic Regression Model

## Fitting the Multiple Logistic Regression Model

## Breast Cancer Example: Population Model

-   We can fit a logistic regression model with both race and ethnicity and age:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\pi(x_i)\right) = & \beta_0
+\beta_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
+\beta_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +\beta_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+\beta_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+\beta_5 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

-   6 total coefficients ($\beta_0$ to $\beta_6$)

## Fitting Multiple Logistic Regression Model

```{r}
multi_bc = glm(Late_stage_diag ~ Race_Ethnicity + Age_c, 
               data = bc, family = binomial)
summary(multi_bc)
```

## Breast Cancer Example: Fitted Model

-   We now have the **fitted logistic regression model** with both race and ethnicity and age:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\widehat{\pi}(x_i)\right) = &-4.56
-0.02 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
-0.09 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +0.13 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+0.36 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+0.06 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

-   6 total coefficients ($\widehat{\beta}_0$ to $\widehat{\beta}_6$)

# Learning Objectives

## Testing Significance of the Coefficients

-   Refer to Lesson 6 for more information on each test!!

 

-   We use the same three tests that we discussed in Simple Logistic Regression to test individual coefficients

    -   [Wald test]{style="background-color:#D5E2F1;"}
    
        -   Can be used to test a single coefficient
        
    -   [~~Score test~~]{style="background-color:#F9E7B8;"}
    -   [Likelihood ratio test (LRT)]{style="background-color:#CADFB8;"}
    
        -   Can be used to test a single coefficient or multiple coefficients
        
 

-   Textbook and our class focuses on Wald and LRT only

## A note on wording

-   When I say "test a single coefficient" or "test multiple coefficients" I am referring to the $\beta$'s

    -   A single variable can have a single coefficient
        -   Example: testing age 
    -   A single variable can have multiple coefficients
        -   Example: testing race and ethnicity
    -   Muliple variables will have multiple coefficients
        -   Example: testing age and race and ethnicity together

## All three tests together

![](./images/three_tests.png){fig-align="center"}

## Wald test (1/3) {background-image="./images/title_blue.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   Very similar to a t-test!

    -   But slightly different because it based in our likelihood function

-   Assumes test statistic W follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis

-   Test statistic: $$W=\frac{{\hat{\beta}}_j}{se({\hat{\beta}}_j)}\sim N(0,1)$$

    -   where $\widehat{\beta}_j$ is a MLE of coefficient $j$

-   95% Wald confidence interval: $${\hat{\beta}}_1\pm1.96 \cdot SE_{{\hat{\beta}}_j}$$

-   The Wald test is a routine output in R (`summary()` of `glm()` output)

    -   Includes $SE_{{\hat{\beta}}_j}$ and can easily find confidence interval with `tidy()`
    
## Wald test procedure with confidence intervals {background-image="./images/title_blue.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

1.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} $\alpha$

2.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"}

    -   In symbols
    -   In words
    -   Alternative: one- or two-sided?

3.  Calculate the [**confidence interval**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} and [**determine if it overlaps with null**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"}

    -   Overlap with null (usually 0 for coefficient) = fail to reject null
    -   No overlap with null (usually 0 for coefficient) = reject null

4.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#5B9BD5"} to the hypothesis test

    -   What is the estimate and its confidence interval?
    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem
    
## Wald test (1/3) {background-image="./images/title_blue.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   From our multiple logistic regression model:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\pi(x_i)\right) = & \beta_0
+\beta_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
+\beta_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +\beta_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+\beta_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+\beta_5 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

-   We can only test the coefficient for age using the Wald test!

## Example 1: Single, continuous variable: Age

## Likelihood ratio test (1/3) {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   Likelihood ratio test answers the question:

    -   For a specific covariate, **which model tell us more about the outcome variable**: the model including the covariate or the model omitting the covariate?
    -   Aka: Which model is more likely given our data: model including the covariate or the model omitting the covariate?

 

-   Test a single coefficient by comparing different models

    -   **Very similar to the F-test**

 

-   Important: LRT can be used conduct hypothesis tests for **multiple coefficients**

    -   Just like F-test, we can test a single coefficient, continuous/binary covariate, multi-level covariate, or multiple covariates
    
## Likelihood ratio test (2/3) {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   Likelihood ratio test answers the question:
    
     
    
    -   For a specific covariate, **which model tell us more about the outcome variable**: the model including the covariate or the model omitting the covariate?

     
    
    -   For a set of covariates, **which model tell us more about the outcome variable**: the model including the set of covariates or the model omitting the set of covariates?

## Likelihood ratio test (3/3) {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   If testing single variable and it’s continuous or binary, still use this hypothesis test:
	
    -   $H_0$: $\beta_j = 0$
    -   $H_1$: $\beta_j \neq 0$

 

-   If testing single variable and it’s categorical with 𝒊 groups (𝑖>2), use this hypothesis test:
    
    -   $H_0$: $\beta_j=\beta_{j+1}=\ldots=\beta_{j+i-1}=0$
    -   $H_1$: at least one of the above $\beta$’s is not equal to 0


 

-   If testing a set of variables, use this hypothesis test:

    -   $H_0$: $\beta_1=\beta_{2}=\ldots=\beta_{k}=0$
    -   $H_1$: at least one of the above $\beta$’s is not equal to 0

## LRT procedure {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

1.  Set the [**level of significance**]{style="color:#70AD47"} $\alpha$

2.  Specify the [**null**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_0$ ) and [**alternative**]{style="color:#70AD47"} ( $H_A$ ) [**hypotheses**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

    -   In symbols
    -   In words
    -   Alternative: one- or two-sided?

3.  Calculate the [**test statistic**]{style="color:#70AD47"} and [**p-value**]{style="color:#70AD47"}

4.  Write a [**conclusion**]{style="color:#70AD47"} to the hypothesis test

    -   Do we reject or fail to reject $H_0$?
    -   Write a conclusion in the context of the problem

## Likelihood ratio test (3/3) {background-image="./images/title_green.png" background-size="2500px 150px" background-position="top"}

-   From our multiple logistic regression model:

$$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\pi(x_i)\right) = & \beta_0
+\beta_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
+\beta_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +\beta_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+\beta_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+\beta_5 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

-   We can test a single coefficient or multiple coefficients

    -   Single, continuous variable: Age

    -   Single, >2 categorical variable: Race and Ethnicity

    -   Set of variables: Race and Ethnicity, and Age

## Example 1: Single, continuous variable: Age

## Example 2: Single, >2 categorical variable: Race and Ethnicity

## Example 3: Set of variables: Race and Ethnicity, and Age

## Notes on Likelihood Ratio Test

-   Likelihood ratio test is only suitable to test “nested” models

-   “Nested” models means the bigger model (full model) contains all the independent variables of the smaller model (reduced model)

-   We cannot compare the following two models using LRT:

    -   Model 1: $$ \begin{aligned} \text{logit}\left(\pi(x_i)\right) = & \beta_0 +\beta_1 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right) +\beta_2 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\ & +\beta_3 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right) +\beta_4 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right) \end{aligned}$$

    -   Model 2: $$\begin{aligned} \text{logit}\left(\pi(x_i)\right) = & \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot Age  \end{aligned}$$

-   If the two models to be compared are not nested, likelihood ratio test should not be used

# Learning Objectives

## Estimated/Predicted Probability for MLR

-   Basic idea for predicting/estimating probability stays the same

-   Calculations will be slightly different

    -   Especially for the confidence interval

-   Recall our fitted model for late stage breast cancer diagnosis: $$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\widehat{\pi}(x_i)\right) = &-4.56
-0.02 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
-0.09 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +0.13 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+0.36 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+0.06 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

## Predicted Probability

-   We may be interested in predicting probability of having a late stage breast cancer diagnosis for a specific age.
-   The predicted probability is the estimated probability of having the event for given values of covariate(s)
-   Recall our fitted model for late stage breast cancer diagnosis: $$ \begin{aligned}
\text{logit}\left(\widehat{\pi}(x_i)\right) = &-4.56
-0.02 \cdot I \left( R/E = H/L \right)
-0.09 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH AIAN \right) \\
& +0.13 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH API \right)
+0.36 \cdot I \left( R/E = NH B \right)
+0.06 \cdot Age 
\end{aligned}$$

-   We can convert it to the predicted probability: $$\hat{\pi}\left(X\right)=\frac{\exp({\hat{\beta}}_0+{\hat{\beta}}_1X)}{1+\exp({\hat{\beta}}_0+{\hat{\beta}}_1X)}$$

    -   This is an inverse logit calculation

-   We can calculate this using the the `predict()` function like in BSTA 512

    - Another option: taking inverse logit of fitted values from `augment()` function

# Learning Objectives

## Multivariable Logistic Regression Model

-   The multivariable model of logistic regression (called multiple logistic regression) is useful in that it statistically adjusts the estimated effect of each variable in the model

-   Each estimated coefficient provides an estimate of the log odds adjusting for all other variables included in the model

-   The **adjusted odds ratio** can be different from or similar to the unadjusted odds ratio

-   Comparing adjusted vs. unadjusted odds ratios is a useful activity. 

## Interpretation of Coefficients in MLR

-   The interpretation of coefficients in multiple logistic regression is essentially the same as the interpretation of coefficients in simple logistic regression

-   For interpretation, we need to 

    -   point out that these are adjusted estimates
    -   provide a list of other variables in the model

## Example: Race and Ethnicity and Age model fit



## What does “controlling for” mean? (I)

-   Consider a multivariable model with two independent variables: one dichotomous (the risk factor) and one continuous (say, age)

    -   **Primary interest:** to estimate the effect of the risk factor on the outcome variable

    -   But we want to assess whether to adjust for age

-   Adjusting for age **may not be necessary** if age distribution is quite similar for the exposed and unexposed groups

-   But if the **age distribution does differs for the two groups** (for example, the exposed group are older than the unexposed group), **we need to adjust for age** using multivariable regression modeling
